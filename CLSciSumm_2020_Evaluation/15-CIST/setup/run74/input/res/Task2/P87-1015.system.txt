In the remainder of the paper , we outline how a class of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems ( LCFRS\ 's ) may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows . In defining LCFRS\ 's , we hope to generalize the definition of CFG\ 's to formalisms manipulating any structure , e.g . In defining LCFRS\ 's , we hope to generalize the definition of CFG\ 's to formalisms manipulating any structure , e.g . In the remainder of the paper , we outline how a class of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems ( LCFRS\ 's ) may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows . In defining LCFRS\ 's , we hope to generalize the definition of CFG\ 's to formalisms manipulating any structure , e.g . A multicomponent Tree Adjoining Grammar ( MCTAG ) consists of a finite set of finite elementary tree sets . In defining LCFRS\ 's , we hope to generalize the definition of CFG\ 's to formalisms manipulating any structure , e.g . We outlined the definition of a family of constrained grammatical formalisms , called Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems . In considering this aspect of a formalism , we hope to better understand the relationship between the structural descriptions generated by the grammars of a formalism , and the properties of semilinearity and polynomial recognizability . We now turn our attention to the recognition of string languages generated by these formalisms ( LCFRL\
