Results We first compare our system with Clarke et al . This algorithm is linear in the number of nodes times the size of the denotations.1 Now the dual importance of trees in DCS is clear : We have seen that trees parallel syntactic dependency structure , which will facilitate parsing . This algorithm is linear in the number of nodes times the size of the denotations.1 Now the dual importance of trees in DCS is clear : We have seen that trees parallel syntactic dependency structure , which will facilitate parsing . We now turn to the task of mapping natural language For the example in Figure 4 ( b ) , the de- utterances to DCS trees . This algorithm is linear in the number of nodes times the size of the denotations.1 Now the dual importance of trees in DCS is clear : We have seen that trees parallel syntactic dependency structure , which will facilitate parsing . Results We first compare our system with Clarke et al . However , we still model the logical form ( now as a latent variable ) to capture the complexities of language . In this paper , we learn to map questions to answers via latent logical forms , which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs . We now turn to the task of mapping natural language For the example in Figure 4 ( b ) , the de- utterances to DCS trees . Results We first compare our
