Consider the German sentence ( 1 ) daran wird ihn Anna erkennen , & amp ; di er weint at-it will him Anna recognise that he cries \'Anna will recognise him at his cry\ ' A sample constituent structure is given below : The fairly short sentence contains three non-local dependencies , marked by co-references between traces and the corresponding nodes . Thus , notions such as head should be distinguished at the level of syntactic functions rather than structures .

We describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages . Realworld texts annotated with different strata of linguistic information can be used for grammar induction . During annotation , the highest rated grammatical function labels Gi are calculated using the Viterbi algorithm and assigned to the structure , i.e. The following commands are available : The three tagsets used by the annotation tool ( for words , phrases , and edges ) are variable and are stored together with the
