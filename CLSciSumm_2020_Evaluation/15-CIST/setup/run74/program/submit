Three state-of-the-art statistical parsers are combined to produce more accurate parses, as well as new bounds on achievable Treebank parsing accuracy.
Each parse is converted into a set of constituents represented as a tuples: (label, start, end).
The set is then compared with the set generated from the Penn Treebank parse to determine the precision and recall.
Adding the isolated constituents to our hypothesis parse could increase our expected recall, but in the cases we investigated it would invariably hurt our precision more than we would gain on recall.
