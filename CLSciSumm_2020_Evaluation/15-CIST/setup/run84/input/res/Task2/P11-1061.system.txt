The function A : F & The supervised POS tagging accuracies ( on this tagset ) are shown in the last row of Table 2 . The supervised POS tagging accuracies ( on this tagset ) are shown in the last row of Table 2 . Graph construction does not require any labeled data , but makes use of two similarity functions . However , supervised methods rely on labeled training data , which is time-consuming and expensive to generate . For each language under consideration , Petrov et al . Across eight European languages , our approach results in an average absolute improvement of 10.4 % over a state-of-the-art baseline , and 16.7 % over vanilla hidden Markov models induced with the Expectation Maximization algorithm . For each trigram type x2 x3 x4 in a sequence x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 , we count how many times that trigram type co-occurs with the different instantiations of each concept , and compute the point-wise mutual information ( PMI ) between the two.5 The similarity between two trigram types is given by summing over the PMI values over feature instantiations that they have in common . We briefly review it here for completeness . We use the universal POS tagset of Petrov et al . For each language under consideration , Petrov et al . For English POS tagging , BergKirkpatrick et al . This formulation of the constraint feature is equivalent to the use of a tagging dictionary extracted from
