8217 ; s exact test to determine which verbs and nouns showed the greatest variation in landmark preference and items with p-values greater than 0.001 were discarded . 174 ; v is a matrix whose components are all the possible products uivj of the components of vectors u and v. As can be seen , all models are significantly correlated with the human ratings . Evaluation Methodology We evaluated the proposed composition models in two ways . Despite the popularity of additive models , our experimental results showed the superiority of models utilizing multiplicative combinations , at least for the sentence similarity task attempted here . Further constraints can be introduced to reduce the free parameters in these models . Our work proposes a framework for vector composition which allows the derivation of different types of models and licenses two fundamental composition operations , multiplication and addition ( and their combination ) . This poses problems for modeling linguistic data which is typically represented by vectors with non-random structure . 945 ; to 0.4 and & The projection is defined in terms of circular convolution a mathematical function that compresses the tensor product of two vectors . Further constraints can be introduced to reduce the free parameters in these models . Here , semantic analysis is guided by syntactic structure , and therefore sentences ( 1-a ) and ( 1-b ) receive distinct representations . We formulated composition as a function of two vectors and introduced several models based on
