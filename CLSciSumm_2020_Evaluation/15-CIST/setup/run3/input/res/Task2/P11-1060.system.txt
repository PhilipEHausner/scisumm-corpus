CCG ( Steedman , 2000 ) , in which semantic pars- The integration of natural language with denotaing is driven from the lexicon . Inspecting the final parameters calculus formulae . As in Clarke et al . ( 2009 ) induces conjunctive formulae and ciently large K. The denotation JzKw ( z evaluated on w ) is the set of consistent values of the root node ( see Figure 2 for an example ) . In this paper , we learn to map questions to answers via latent logical forms , which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs . The closest work to ours is Clarke on compositional semantics . Feedback from the context ; for example , the lexical entry for borders world has been used to guide both syntactic parsing is S\\NP/NP : Ay.Ax.border ( x , y ) , which means ( Schuler , 2003 ) and semantic parsing ( Popescu et borders looks right for the first argument and left al. , 2003 ; Clarke et al. , 2010 ) . Next , we compared our
