The dominant paradigm in compositional semantics is Montague semantics , which constructs lambda calculus forms in a bottom-up manner . ( 2010 ) ( henceforth , SEMRESP ) , which also learns a semantic parser from question-answer pairs . 8712 ; ZL ( x ) given an utterance x . 8712 ; ZL ( x ) given an utterance x . There has been a fair amount of past work on no predicates ) , confusion of Washington state with this topic : Liang et al . Aggregate relation DCS trees that only use join relations can represent arbitrarily complex compositional structures , but they can not capture higherorder phenomena in language . The dominant paradigm in compositional semantics is Montague semantics , which constructs lambda calculus forms in a bottom-up manner . The dominant paradigm in compositional semantics is Montague semantics , which constructs lambda calculus forms in a bottom-up manner . uses them as features in another learning problem . In tackling this challenging learning problem , we introduce a new semantic representation which highlights a parallel between dependency syntax and efficient evaluation of logical forms . The closest work to ours is Clarke on compositional semantics . Table 3 shows that even DCS , which does not use prototypes , is comparable to the best previous system ( Kwiatkowski et al. , 2010 ) , and by adding a few prototypes , DCS+ offers a decisive edge ( 91.1 % over 88.9 % on GEO ) .
