In considering the relationship between formalisms, we show that it is useful to abstract away from the details of the formalism, and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees. find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by Context-Free Grammars On the basis of this observation, we describe a class of formalisms which we call Linear Context- Free Rewriting Systems, and show they are recognizable in polynomial time and generate only semilinear languages. Much of the study of grammatical systems in computational linguistics has been focused on the weak generative capacity of grammatical formalism. In the remainder of the paper, we outline how a class of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS\'s) may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows. In considering this aspect of a formalism, we hope to better understand the relationship between the structural descriptions generated by the grammars of a formalism, and the properties of semilinearity and polynomial recognizability. We now turn our attention to the recognition of string languages generated by these formalisms (LCFRL\'s). The rewrite rules and the definition of the composition operations may be stored in the finite state control since G uses a finite number of them. LCFRS\'s have only been loosely defined in this paper; we have yet to provide a complete set of formal properties associated with members of this
