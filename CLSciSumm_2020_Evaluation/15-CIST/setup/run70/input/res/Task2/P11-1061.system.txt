We describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part-of-speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language. However, supervised methods rely on labeled training data, which is time-consuming and expensive to generate. Unsupervised learning approaches appear to be a natural solution to this problem, as they require only unannotated text for training models. To make the projection practical, we rely on the twelve universal part-of-speech tags of Petrov et al. (2011). Supervised part-of-speech (POS) taggers, for example, approach the level of inter-annotator agreement (Shen et al., 2007, 97.3% accuracy for English). Unfortunately, the best completely unsupervised English POS tagger (that does not make use of a tagging dictionary) reaches only 76.1% accuracy (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2010), making its practical usability questionable at best. Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Tagging with Bilingual Graph-Based Projection. Our method does not assume any knowledge about the target language (in particular no tagging dictionary is assumed), making it applicable to a wide array of resource-poor languages. While there might be some controversy about the exact definition of such a tagset, these 12 categories cover the most frequent part-of-speech and exist in one form or another in all of the languages that we studied. For each language under consideration, Petrov et al. (2011) provide a mapping A from the fine-grained language specific POS tags in the foreign treebank to the universal POS tags. Graph construction does not require any labeled data, but makes use of two similarity functions. Our monolingual
