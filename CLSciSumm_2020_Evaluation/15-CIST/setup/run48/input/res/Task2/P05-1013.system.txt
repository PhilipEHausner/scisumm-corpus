We show how a datadriven deterministic dependency parser , in itself restricted to projective structures , can be combined with graph transformation techniques to produce non-projective structures . 168 ; arvinen ( 1997 ) and Wang and Harper ( 2004 ) for English , Foth et al . 8211 ; 2 % . We show how a datadriven deterministic dependency parser , in itself restricted to projective structures , can be combined with graph transformation techniques to produce non-projective structures . 8593 ; h for each lifted arc , where d is the dependency relation between the syntactic head and the dependent in the non-projective representation , and h is the dependency relation that the syntactic head has to its own head in the underlying structure . By applying an inverse transformation to the output of the parser , arcs with non-standard labels can be lowered to their proper place in the dependency graph , giving rise 1The dependency graph has been modified to make the final period a dependent of the main verb instead of being a dependent of a special root node for the sentence . As observed by Kahane et al . 8593 ; h for each lifted arc , where d is the dependency relation between the syntactic head and the dependent in the non-projective representation , and h is the dependency relation that the syntactic head has to its own head in the underlying structure . In section 4 we
