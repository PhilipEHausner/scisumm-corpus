Phrase tables were extracted from the IN and OUT training corpora ( not the dev as was used for instance weighting models ) , and phrase pairs in the intersection of the IN and OUT phrase tables were used as positive examples , with two alternate definitions of negative examples : The classifier trained using the 2nd definition had higher accuracy on a development set . Linear weights are difficult to incorporate into the standard MERT procedure because they are & When OUT is large and distinct , its contribution can be controlled by training separate IN and OUT models , and weighting their combination . The matching sentence pairs are then added to the IN corpus , and the system is re-trained . Moving beyond directly related work , major themes in SMT adaptation include the IR ( Hildebrand et al. , 2005 ; L & # 168 ; u et al. , 2007 ; Zhao et al. , 2004 ) and mixture ( Finch and Sumita , 2008 ; Foster and Kuhn , 2007 ; Koehn and Schroeder , 2007 ; L & # 168 ; u et al. , 2007 ) approaches for LMs and TMs described above , as well as methods for exploiting monolingual in-domain text , typically by translating it automatically and then performing self training ( Bertoldi and Federico , 2009 ; Ueffing et al. , 2007 ; Schwenk and Senellart , 2009 ) . However , it is robust , efficient ,
