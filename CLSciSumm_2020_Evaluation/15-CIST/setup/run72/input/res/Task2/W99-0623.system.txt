Finally we show the combining techniques degrade very little when a poor parser is added to the set . We plan to explore more powerful techniques for exploiting the diversity of parsing methods . We plan to explore more powerful techniques for exploiting the diversity of parsing methods . Finally we show the combining techniques degrade very little when a poor parser is added to the set . The average individual parser accuracy was reduced by more than 5 % when we added this new parser , but the precision of the constituent voting technique was the only result that decreased significantly . Adding the isolated constituents to our hypothesis parse could increase our expected recall , but in the cases we investigated it would invariably hurt our precision more than we would gain on recall . In this case we are interested in finding\ ' the maximum probability parse , ri , and Mi is the set of relevant ( binary ) parsing decisions made by parser i. In this case we are interested in finding\ ' the maximum probability parse , ri , and Mi is the set of relevant ( binary ) parsing decisions made by parser i. Another technique for parse hybridization is to use a na & 239 ; ve Bayes classifier to determine which constituents to include in the parse . Since our goal is to perform well under these measures we will similarly treat constituents as the minimal substructures for combination . In
