Because generative statistical models had already proven successful for each of the first three stages , we were optimistic that some of their properties & Finally , our newly constructed parser , like that of ( Collins 1997 ) , was based on a generative statistical model . For the following example , the The Template Relations ( TR ) task involves identifying instances of three relations in the text : TR builds on TE in that TR reports binary relations between elements of TE . To train our integrated model , we required a large corpus of augmented parse trees . 8212 ; especially their ability to learn from large amounts of data , and their robustness when presented with unexpected inputs & We have demonstrated , at least for one problem , that a lexicalized , probabilistic context-free parser with head rules ( LPCFGHR ) can be used effectively for information extraction . We have demonstrated , at least for one problem , that a lexicalized , probabilistic context-free parser with head rules ( LPCFGHR ) can be used effectively for information extraction . An integrated model can limit the propagation of errors by making all decisions jointly . Instead , our parsing algorithm , trained on the UPenn TREEBANK , was run on the New York Times source to create unsupervised syntactic training which was constrained to be consistent with semantic annotation . An integrated model can limit the propagation of errors by making all decisions jointly
