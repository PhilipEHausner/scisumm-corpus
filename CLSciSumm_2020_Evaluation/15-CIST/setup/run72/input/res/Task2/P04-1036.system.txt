Furthermore , we demonstrate that our method discovers appropriate predominant senses for words from two domainspecific corpora . Whilst there are a few hand-tagged corpora available for some languages , one would expect the frequency distribution of the senses of words , particularly topical words , to depend on the genre and domain of the text under consideration . This provides the nearest neighbours to each target word , along with the distributional similarity score between the target word and its neighbour . They evaluate using the lin measure described above in section 2.2 to determine the precision and recall of these discovered classes with respect to WordNet synsets . 7 This is a hand-tagged test suite of 5,000 words of running text from three articles from the Penn Treebank II . It uses the glosses of semantically related ( according to WordNet ) senses too . 7 This is a hand-tagged test suite of 5,000 words of running text from three articles from the Penn Treebank II . Furthermore , we demonstrate that our method discovers appropriate predominant senses for words from two domainspecific corpora . 7 This is a hand-tagged test suite of 5,000 words of running text from three articles from the Penn Treebank II . The results in table 1 show the accuracy of the ranking with respect to SemCor over the entire set of 2595 polysemous nouns in SemCor with the jcn and lesk WordNet similarity measures . We briefly summarise the two measures here
