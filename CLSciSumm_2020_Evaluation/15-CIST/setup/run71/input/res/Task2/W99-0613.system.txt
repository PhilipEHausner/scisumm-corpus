( We would like to note though that unlike previous boosting algorithms , the CoBoost algorithm presented here is not a boosting algorithm under Valiant\ 's ( Valiant 84 ) Probably Approximately Correct ( PAC ) model.. But we will show that the use of unlabeled data can drastically reduce the need for supervision . 971,746 sentences of New York Times text were parsed using the parser of ( Collins 96 ) .1 Word sequences that met the following criteria were then extracted as named entity examples : whose head is a singular noun ( tagged NN ) . Put another way , the minimum of Equ . This section describes AdaBoost , which is the basis for the CoBoost algorithm . 971,746 sentences of New York Times text were parsed using the parser of ( Collins 96 ) .1 Word sequences that met the following criteria were then extracted as named entity examples : whose head is a singular noun ( tagged NN ) . Put another way , the minimum of Equ . Put another way , the minimum of Equ . Recent results ( e.g. , ( Yarowsky 95 ; Brill 95 ; Blum and Mitchell 98 ) ) have suggested that unlabeled data can be used quite profitably in reducing the need for supervision . Several extensions of AdaBoost for multiclass problems have been suggested ( Freund and Schapire 97 ; Schapire and Singer 98 ) . There are two differences between this method and the
