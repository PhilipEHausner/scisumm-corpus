In the past few years, however, some improvements have been made over these language models through the use of statistical methods of natural language processing, and the development of innovative, linguistically well-motivated techniques for improving language models for speech recognition is generating more interest among computational linguists. While language models built around shallow local dependencies are still the standard in state-of-the-art speech recognition systems, there is reason to hope that better language models can and will be developed by computational linguists for this task. Thus, our top-down parser allows for the incremental calculation of generative conditional word probabilities, a property it shares with other left-to-right parsers with rooted derivations such as Earley parsers (Earley 1970) or left-corner parsers (Rosenkrantz and Lewis 11 1970). The standard language model used in many speech recognition systems is the trigram model, i.e., a Markov model of order 2, which can be characterized by the following equation: To smooth the trigram models that are used in this paper, we interpolate the probability estimates of higher-order Markov models with lower-order Markov models (Jelinek and Mercer 1980). We will then present empirical results in two domains: one to compare with previous work in the parsing literature, and the other to compare with previous work using parsing for language modeling for speech recognition, in particular with the Chelba and Jelinek results mentioned above. In addition, as mentioned above, we would like to further test our language model in speech recognition tasks, to see if the perplexity improvement that
