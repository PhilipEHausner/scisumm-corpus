We show how a datadriven deterministic dependency parser, in itself restricted to projective structures, can be combined with graph transformation techniques to produce non-projective structures. Before we turn to the evaluation, however, we need to introduce the data-driven dependency parser used in the latter experiments. In the experiments below, we employ a data-driven deterministic dependency parser producing labeled projective dependency graphs,3 previously tested on Swedish (Nivre et al., 2004) and English (Nivre and Scholz, 2004). We have presented a new method for non-projective dependency parsing, based on a combination of data-driven projective dependency parsing and graph transformation techniques. In order to realize the full potential of dependency-based syntactic parsing, it is desirable to allow non-projective dependency structures. This is true of the widely used link grammar parser for English (Sleator and Temperley, 1993), which uses a dependency grammar of sorts, the probabilistic dependency parser of Eisner (1996), and more recently proposed deterministic dependency parsers (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2004). Experiments using data from the Prague Dependency Treebank show that the combined system can handle nonprojective constructions with a precision sufficient to yield a significant improvement in overall parsing accuracy. Finally, since non-projective constructions often involve long-distance dependencies, the problem is closely related to the recovery of empty categories and non-local dependencies in constituency-based parsing (Johnson, 2002; Dienes and Dubey, 2003; Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2004; Cahill et al., 2004; Levy and Manning, 2004; Campbell, 2004). In this paper, we show how non-projective dependency parsing can be achieved
