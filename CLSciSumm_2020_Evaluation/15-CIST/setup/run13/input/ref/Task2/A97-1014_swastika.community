We will closely coordinate the further development of our corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation. For evaluation, the already annotated sentences were divided into two disjoint sets, one for training (90% of the corpus), the other one for testing (10%). Existing treebank annotation schemes exhibit a fairly uniform architecture, as they all have to meet the same basic requirements, namely: Descriptivity: Grammatical phenomena are to be described rather than explained. Argument structure can be represented in terms of unordered trees (with crossing branches). In the second phase of the project Verbmobil a. treebank for :30,000 German spoken sentences as well as for the same amount of English and Japanese sentences will be created. The work reported in this paper aims at providing syntactically annotated corpora (treebanks') for stochastic grammar induction. These differences can be illustrated by a comparison with the Penn Treebank annotation scheme. As the need for certain functionalities becomes obvious with growing annotation experience, we have decided to implement the tool in two stages. Consider the German sentence (1) daran wird ihn Anna erkennen, &amp;di er weint at-it will him Anna recognise that he cries 'Anna will recognise him at his cry' A sample constituent structure is given below: The fairly short sentence contains three non-local dependencies, marked by co-references between traces and the corresponding nodes. In order to avoid inconsistencies, the corpus is annotated in two stages: basic annotation and nfirtellte714.
