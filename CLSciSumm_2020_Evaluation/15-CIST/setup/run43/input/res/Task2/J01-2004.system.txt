In the past few years, however, some improvements have been made over these language models through the use of statistical methods of natural language processing, and the development of innovative, linguistically well-motivated techniques for improving language models for speech recognition is generating more interest among computational linguists. A second key feature of our approach is that top-down guidance improves the efficiency of the search as more and more conditioning events are extracted from the derivation for use in the probabilistic model. The standard language model used in many speech recognition systems is the trigram model, i.e., a Markov model of order 2, which can be characterized by the following equation: To smooth the trigram models that are used in this paper, we interpolate the probability estimates of higher-order Markov models with lower-order Markov models (Jelinek and Mercer 1980). The structured language model (SLM) used in Chelba and Jelinek (1998a, 1998b, 1999), Jelinek and Chelba (1999), and Chelba (2000) is similar to that of Goddeau, except that (i) their shift-reduce parser follows a nondeterministic beam search, and (ii) each stack entry contains, in addition to the nonterminal node label, the headword of the constituent. We will then present empirical results in two domains: one to compare with previous work in the parsing literature, and the other to compare with previous work using parsing for language modeling for speech recognition, in particular with the Chelba and Jelinek results mentioned above. In addition, as mentioned above, we would like to further test our
