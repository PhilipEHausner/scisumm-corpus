A more scrupulous evaluation requires directly correlating all the individual participants & The merits of different approaches are illustrated with a few hand picked examples and parameter values and large scale evaluations are uniformly absent ( see Frank et al .

( 2007 ) for a criticism of Kintsch & A more scrupulous evaluation requires directly correlating all the individual participants & Combining the multiplicative model with an additive model , which does not suffer from this problem , could mitigate this problem : pi = & Here , we are interested in relative differences , since the two types of ratings correspond to different scales . In contrast , if we assume that f is a linear function of the tensor product of u and v , then we obtain multiplicative models : where C is a tensor of rank 3 , which projects the tensor product of u and v onto the space of p. So , if we assume that only the ith components of u and v contribute to the ith component of p , that these components are not dependent on i , and that the function is symmetric with regard to the interchange of
