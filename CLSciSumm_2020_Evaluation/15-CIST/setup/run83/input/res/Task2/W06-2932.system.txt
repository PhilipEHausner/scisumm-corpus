These results show that the discriminative spanning tree parsing framework ( McDonald et al. , 2005b ; McDonald and Pereira , 2006 ) is easily adapted across all these languages . For score functions , we use simple dot products between high dimensional feature representations and a weight vector Assuming we have an appropriate feature representation , we can find the highest scoring label sequence with Viterbi & These results show that the discriminative spanning tree parsing framework ( McDonald et al. , 2005b ; McDonald and Pereira , 2006 ) is easily adapted across all these languages . assignment of edge labels instead of individual assignment , and a rich feature set that incorporates morphological properties when available . For score functions , we use simple dot products between high dimensional feature representations and a weight vector Assuming we have an appropriate feature representation , we can find the highest scoring label sequence with Viterbi & To model this we treat the labeling of the edges ( i , j1 ) , ... Not all data sets in our experiments include morphological features , so we use them only when available . The first stage of our system creates an unlabeled parse y for an input sentence x . 8211 ; 220 , New York City , June 2006. We have presented results showing that the spanning tree dependency parsing framework of McDonald et al .
