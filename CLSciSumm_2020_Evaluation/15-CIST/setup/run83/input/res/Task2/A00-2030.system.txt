8212 ; especially their ability to learn from large amounts of data , and their robustness when presented with unexpected inputs & Because generative statistical models had already proven successful for each of the first three stages , we were optimistic that some of their properties & Figure 4 shows an example of the semantic annotation , which was the only type of manual annotation we performed . To train our integrated model , we required a large corpus of augmented parse trees . Given a new sentence , the outcome of this search process is a tree structure that encodes both the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentence . This simple semantic annotation was the only source of task knowledge used to configure the model . We evaluated the new approach to information extraction on two of the tasks of the Seventh Message Understanding Conference ( MUC-7 ) and reported in ( Marsh , 1998 ) . If the single generalized model could then be extended to semantic analysis , all necessary sentence level processing would be contained in that model . A single model proved capable of performing all necessary sentential processing , both syntactic and semantic .
