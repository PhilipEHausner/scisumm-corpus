Besides this perceptron , other sub-models are trained and used as additional features of the outside-layer linear model . Besides this perceptron , other sub-models are trained and used as additional features of the outside-layer linear model . Test results listed in Table 2 shows that this model obtains higher accuracy than the best of SIGHAN Bakeoff 2 in three corpora ( AS , CityU and MSR ) . We trained a character-based perceptron for Chinese Joint S & amp ; T , and found that the perceptron itself could achieve considerably high accuracy on segmentation and Joint S & amp ; T. Besides this perceptron , other sub-models are trained and used as additional features of the outside-layer linear model . We called them non-lexical-target because predications derived from them can predicate without considering the current character C0 . Test results listed in Table 2 shows that this model obtains higher accuracy than the best of SIGHAN Bakeoff 2 in three corpora ( AS , CityU and MSR ) . We propose a cascaded linear model for joint Chinese word segmentation and partof-speech tagging . 955 ; tw denote the corresponding weights of the two components . To compare with others conveniently , we excluded the ones forbidden by the close test regulation of SIGHAN , for example , Pu ( C0 ) , indicating whether character C0 is a punctuation . We add a field C0 to each template in the upper column , so that it can
