In this work the lists of neighbours are themselves clustered to bring out the various senses of the word . Whilst there are a few hand-tagged corpora available for some languages , one would expect the frequency distribution of the senses of words , particularly topical words , to depend on the genre and domain of the text under consideration .

In this work the lists of neighbours are themselves clustered to bring out the various senses of the word . Additionally , we need to determine whether senses which do not occur in a wide variety of grammatical contexts fare badly using distributional measures of similarity , and what can be done to combat this problem using relation specific thesauruses . Identification of these domain labels for word senses was semiautomatic and required a considerable amount of hand-labelling . We briefly summarise the two measures here ; for a more detailed summary see ( Patwardhan et al. , 2003 ) . In this work the lists of neighbours are themselves clustered to bring out the various senses of the word . 7 This is a hand-tagged test suite of 5,000 words of running text from three articles from the Penn Treebank II .
