Since the derivation tees of TAG\ 's , MCTAG\ 's , and HG\ 's are local sets , the choice of the structure used at each point in a derivation in these systems does not depend on the context at that point within the derivation . 0n0\'i\'i0\'2 & amp ; quot ; bin242bn I n = 711 + n2 } On the other hand , no linguistic use is made of this general form of composition and Steedman ( personal communication ) and Steedman ( 1986 ) argues that a more limited definition of composition is more natural . Since the derivation tees of TAG\ 's , MCTAG\ 's , and HG\ 's are local sets , the choice of the structure used at each point in a derivation in these systems does not depend on the context at that point within the derivation . Since the derivation tees of TAG\ 's , MCTAG\ 's , and HG\ 's are local sets , the choice of the structure used at each point in a derivation in these systems does not depend on the context at that point within the derivation . If 7 is an elementary tree , the derivation tree consists of a single node labeled 7 . This suggests that by generalizing the notion of context-freeness in CFG\ 's , we can define a class of grammatical formalisms that manipulate more complex structures . 8226 ; & If 7 is an elementary tree , the derivation tree consists
