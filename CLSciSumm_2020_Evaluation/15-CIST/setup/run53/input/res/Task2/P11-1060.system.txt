8217 ; s denotation ( t & # 8712 ; JciKw ) . Although a DCS tree is a logical form , note that it looks like a syntactic dependency tree with predicates in place of words . These rules are often too stringent , cused on aligning text to a world ( Liang et al. , 2009 ) , and for complex utterances , especially in free word- using text in reinforcement learning ( Branavan et al. , order languages , either disharmonic combinators are 2009 ; Branavan et al. , 2010 ) , and many others . 8217 ; s denotation ( t & # 8712 ; JciKw ) . 8217 ; s denotation ( t & # 8712 ; JciKw ) . There has been a fair amount of past work on no predicates ) , confusion of Washington state with this topic : Liang et al . Answering these types of complex questions compositionally involves first mapping the questions into logical forms ( semantic parsing ) . In this paper , we learn to map questions to answers via latent logical forms , which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs . Aggregate relation DCS trees that only use join relations can represent arbitrarily complex compositional structures , but they can not capture higherorder phenomena in language .
