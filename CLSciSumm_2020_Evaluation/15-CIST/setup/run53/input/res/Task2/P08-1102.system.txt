According to Ng and Low ( 2004 ) , the segmentation task can be transformed to a tagging problem by assigning each character a boundary tag of the following four types : We can extract segmentation result by splitting the labelled result into subsequences of pattern s or bm*e which denote single-character word and multicharacter word respectively . In theory , any useful knowledge can be incorporated into the perceptron directly , besides the characterbased features already adopted . Word segmentation and part-of-speech ( POS ) tagging are important tasks in computer processing of Chinese and other Asian languages . As predications generated from such templates depend on the current character , we name these templates lexical-target .
