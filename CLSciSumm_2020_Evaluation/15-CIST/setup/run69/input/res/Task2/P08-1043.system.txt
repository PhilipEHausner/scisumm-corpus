In our third model GTppp we also add the distinction between general PPs and possessive PPs following Goldberg and Elhadad ( 2007 ) . Using a wide-coverage morphological analyzer based on ( Itai et al. , 2006 ) should cater for a better coverage , and incorporating lexical probabilities learned from a big ( unannotated ) corpus ( cf . ( Levinger et al. , 1995 ; Goldberg et al. , ; Adler et al. , 2008 ) ) will make the parser more robust and suitable for use in more realistic scenarios . In our third model GTppp we also add the distinction between general PPs and possessive PPs following Goldberg and Elhadad ( 2007 ) . The Input The set of analyses for a token is thus represented as a lattice in which every arc corresponds to a specific lexeme l , as shown in Figure 1 . 8217 ; an et al . Here we push the single-framework conjecture across the board and present a single model that performs morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation in a fully generative framework . This is by now a fairly standard representation for multiple morphological segmentation of Hebrew utterances ( Adler , 2001 ; Bar-Haim et al. , 2005 ; Smith et al. , 2005 ; Cohen and Smith , 2007 ; Adler , 2007 ) . Using a treebank grammar , a data-driven lexicon , and a linguistically motivated unknown-tokens handling technique our model outperforms previous pipelined , integrated or
