Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Tagging with Bilingual Graph-Based Projection. We describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part-of-speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language. Unsupervised learning approaches appear to be a natural solution to this problem, as they require only unannotated text for training models. To make the projection practical, we rely on the twelve universal part-of-speech tags of Petrov et al. (2011). Supervised part-of-speech (POS) taggers, for example, approach the level of inter-annotator agreement (Shen et al., 2007, 97.3% accuracy for English). However, supervised methods rely on labeled training data, which is time-consuming and expensive to generate. The focus of this work is on building POS taggers for foreign languages, assuming that we have an English POS tagger and some parallel text between the two languages. Unfortunately, the best completely unsupervised English POS tagger (that does not make use of a tagging dictionary) reaches only 76.1% accuracy (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2010), making its practical usability questionable at best. For each language under consideration, Petrov et al. (2011) provide a mapping A from the fine-grained language specific POS tags in the foreign treebank to the universal POS tags. As discussed in more detail in &#167;3, we use two types of vertices in our graph: on the foreign language side vertices correspond to trigram types, while the vertices on the English side are individual word types. The foreign language vertices (denoted by Vf) correspond to foreign trigram types, exactly as in Subramanya
