2 Segmentation and POS Tagging Given a Chinese character sequence: while the segmentation and POS tagging result can be depicted as: Here, Ci (i = L.n) denotes Chinese character, ti (i = L.m) denotes POS tag, and Cl:r (l &lt; r) denotes character sequence ranges from Cl to Cr. We trained a character-based perceptron for Chinese Joint S&amp;T, and found that the perceptron itself could achieve considerably high accuracy on segmentation and Joint S&amp;T. In Chinese Joint S&amp;T, the mission of the decoder is to find the boundary-POS labelled sequence with the highest score. Given a Chinese character sequence C1:n, the decoding procedure can proceed in a left-right fashion with a dynamic programming approach. According to Ng and Low (2004), the segmentation task can be transformed to a tagging problem by assigning each character a boundary tag of the following four types: We can extract segmentation result by splitting the labelled result into subsequences of pattern s or bm*e which denote single-character word and multicharacter word respectively. The perceptron has been used in many NLP tasks, such as POS tagging (Collins, 2002), Chinese word segmentation (Ng and Low, 2004; Zhang and Clark, 2007) and so on. The feature templates we adopted are selected from those of Ng and Low (2004). Using W = w1:m to denote the word sequence, T = t1:m to denote the corresponding POS sequence, P (T |W) to denote the probability that W is labelled as T, and P(W|T) to denote the probability that T generates
