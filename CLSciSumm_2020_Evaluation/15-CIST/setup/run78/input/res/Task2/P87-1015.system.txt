We now turn our attention to the recognition of string languages generated by these formalisms ( LCFRL\ 's ) . ( 1975 ) and later redefined by Joshi ( 1987 ) in which the adjunction operation is defined on sets of elementary trees rather than single trees . In considering this aspect of a formalism , we hope to better understand the relationship between the structural descriptions generated by the grammars of a formalism , and the properties of semilinearity and polynomial recognizability . Hence , trees shown in Figure 8 can not be generated by any MCTAG ( but can be generated by an IG ) because the number of pairs of dependent paths grows with n. We now turn our attention to the recognition of string languages generated by these formalisms ( LCFRL\ 's ) . A geometrical progression of language families defined by Weir ( 1987 ) involves tree sets with increasingly complex path sets . A geometrical progression of language families defined by Weir ( 1987 ) involves tree sets with increasingly complex path sets . Since these path sets are semilinear , the property of independent paths in their tree sets is sufficient to cause semilinearity of the languages generated by them . These systems are similar to those described by Pollard ( 1984 ) as Generalized Context-Free Grammars ( GCFG\ 's ) . In considering the relationship between formalisms , we show that it is useful to abstract away from the details of the
