Supervised part-of-speech ( POS ) taggers , for example , approach the level of inter-annotator agreement ( Shen et al. , 2007 , 97.3 % accuracy for English ) .

To make the projection practical , we rely on the twelve universal part-of-speech tags of Petrov et al . The focus of this work is on building POS taggers for foreign languages , assuming that we have an English POS tagger and some parallel text between the two languages . 167 ; 3 , we use two types of vertices in our graph : on the foreign
