This has been shown through their successful use in many standard natural language processing tasks , including machine translation ( Ding and Palmer , 2005 ) , sentence compression ( McDonald , 2006 ) , and textual inference ( Haghighi et al. , 2005 ) . That work extends the maximum spanning tree dependency parsing framework ( McDonald et al. , 2005a ; McDonald et al. , 2005b ) to incorporate features over multiple edges in the dependency graph . Furthermore , these results show that a twostage system can achieve a relatively high performance . Not all data sets in our experiments include morphological features , so we use them only when available . We use the MIRA online learner to set the weights ( Crammer and Singer , 2003 ; McDonald et al. , 2005a ) since we found it trained quickly and provide good performance . This system is primarily based on the parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira ( 2006 ) . Furthermore , it made the system homogeneous in terms of learning algorithms since that is what is used to train our unlabeled parser ( McDonald and Pereira , 2006 ) . , xjM , it is often the case that many of these dependencies will have correlated labels . However , in a two stage system we can incorporate features over the entire output of the unlabeled parser since that structure is fixed as input .
