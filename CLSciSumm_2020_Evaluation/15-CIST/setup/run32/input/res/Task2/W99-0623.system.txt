We used these three parsers to explore parser combination techniques . If enough parsers suggest that a particular constituent belongs in the parse , we include it . If enough parsers suggest that a particular constituent belongs in the parse , we include it . The maximum precision oracle is an upper bound on the possible gain we can achieve by parse hybridization . If enough parsers suggest that a particular constituent belongs in the parse , we include it . In this case we are interested in finding\ ' the maximum probability parse , ri , and Mi is the set of relevant ( binary ) parsing decisions made by parser i. In Equations 1 through 3 we develop the model for constructing our parse using na & In Equations 1 through 3 we develop the model for constructing our parse using na & We then show that the combining techniques presented above give better parsing accuracy than any of the individual parsers . The precision and recall of similarity switching and constituent voting are both significantly better than the best individual parser , and constituent voting is significantly better than parser switching in precision.4 Constituent voting gives the highest accuracy for parsing the Penn Treebank reported to date . The corpus-based statistical parsing community has many fast and accurate automated parsing systems , including systems produced by Collins ( 1997 ) , Charniak ( 1997 ) and Ratnaparkhi ( 1997 ) . We call this approach parse hybridization
