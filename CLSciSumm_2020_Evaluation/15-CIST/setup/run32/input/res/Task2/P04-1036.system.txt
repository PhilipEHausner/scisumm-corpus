We have evaluated our method using publically available resources , both for balanced and domain specific text . We present work on the use of a thesaurus acquired from raw textual corpora and the WordNet similarity package to find predominant noun senses automatically . We do not assume that the predominant sense is a method of WSD in itself . jcn ( Jiang and Conrath , 1997 ) This score uses corpus data to populate classes ( synsets ) in the WordNet hierarchy with frequency counts .

We then use the WordNet similarity package ( Patwardhan and Pedersen , 2003 ) to give us a semantic similarity measure ( hereafter referred to as the WordNet similarity measure ) to weight the contribution that each neighbour makes to the various senses of the target word .

There are words where the first sense in WordNet is counter-intuitive , because of the size of the corpus , and because where the
