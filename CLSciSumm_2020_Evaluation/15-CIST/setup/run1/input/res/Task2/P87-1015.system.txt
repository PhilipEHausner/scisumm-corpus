We consider the structural descriptions produced by various grammatical formalisms in terms of the complexity of the paths and the relationship between paths in the sets of structural descriptions that each system can generate. In considering the relationship between formalisms, we show that it is useful to abstract away from the details of the formalism, and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees. find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by Context-Free Grammars On the basis of this observation, we describe a class of formalisms which we call Linear Context- Free Rewriting Systems, and show they are recognizable in polynomial time and generate only semilinear languages. Little attention, however, has been paid to the structural descriptions that these formalisms can assign to strings, i.e. their strong generative capacity. We loosely describe the class of all such systems as Linear Context-Free Rewriting Formalisms. In defining LCFRS\'s, we hope to generalize the definition of CFG\'s to formalisms manipulating any structure, e.g. strings, trees, or graphs. As suggested at the end of Section 3, the restrictions that have been specified in the definition of LCFRS\'s suggest that they can be efficiently recognized. Members of LCFRS whose operations have this property can be translated into the ILFP notation (Rounds, 1985). LCFRS\'s have only been loosely defined in this paper; we have yet to provide a complete set of
