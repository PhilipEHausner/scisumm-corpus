955 ; wt and & Line 4 scans words of all possible lengths l ( l = 1.. min ( i , K ) , where i points to the current considering character ) . With a character-based perceptron as the core , combined with realvalued features such as language models , the cascaded model is able to efficiently utilize knowledge sources that are inconvenient to incorporate into the perceptron directly . To cope with this problem , we propose a cascaded linear model inspired by the log-linear model ( Och and Ney , 2004 ) widely used in statistical machine translation to incorporate different kinds of knowledge sources . We proposed a cascaded linear model for Chinese Joint S & amp ; T. Given a Chinese character sequence C1 : n , the decoding procedure can proceed in a left-right fashion with a dynamic programming approach . We proposed a cascaded linear model for Chinese Joint S & amp ; T. In Chinese Joint S & amp ; T , the mission of the decoder is to find the boundary-POS labelled sequence with the highest score . Besides this perceptron , other sub-models are trained and used as additional features of the outside-layer linear model . Besides this perceptron , other sub-models are trained and used as additional features of the outside-layer linear model . According to Ng and Low ( 2004 ) , the segmentation task can be transformed to a tagging problem by assigning each character a
