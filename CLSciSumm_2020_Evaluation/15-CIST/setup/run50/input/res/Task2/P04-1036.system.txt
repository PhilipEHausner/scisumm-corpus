For every pair of nouns , where each noun had a total frequency in the triple data of 10 or more , we computed their distributional similarity using the measure given by Lin ( 1998 ) .

Even systems which show superior performance to this heuristic often make use of the heuristic where evidence from the context is not sufficient ( Hoste et al. , 2001 ) . Let be the ordered set of the top scoring neighbours of from the thesaurus with associated distributional similarity scores The thesaurus was acquired using the method described by Lin ( 1998 ) .
