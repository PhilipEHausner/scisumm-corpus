We describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part-of-speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language. Supervised part-of-speech (POS) taggers, for example, approach the level of inter-annotator agreement (Shen et al., 2007, 97.3% accuracy for English). Unsupervised learning approaches appear to be a natural solution to this problem, as they require only unannotated text for training models. To make the projection practical, we rely on the twelve universal part-of-speech tags of Petrov et al. (2011). Unfortunately, the best completely unsupervised English POS tagger (that does not make use of a tagging dictionary) reaches only 76.1% accuracy (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2010), making its practical usability questionable at best. The focus of this work is on building POS taggers for foreign languages, assuming that we have an English POS tagger and some parallel text between the two languages. Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Tagging with Bilingual Graph-Based Projection. The POS distributions over the foreign trigram types are used as features to learn a better unsupervised POS tagger (&#167;5). As discussed in more detail in &#167;3, we use two types of vertices in our graph: on the foreign language side vertices correspond to trigram types, while the vertices on the English side are individual word types. The edge weights between the foreign language trigrams are computed using a co-occurence based similarity function, designed to indicate how syntactically similar the middle words of the connected trigrams are (&#167;3.2). To establish a soft correspondence between the two languages,
