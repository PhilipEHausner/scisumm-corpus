Morphological segmentation decisions in our model are delegated to a lexeme-based PCFG and we show that using a simple treebank grammar, a data-driven lexicon, and a linguistically motivated unknown-tokens handling our model outperforms (Tsarfaty, 2006) and (Cohen and Smith, 2007) on the joint task and achieves state-of-the-art results on a par with current respective standalone models.. The current work treats both segmental and super-segmental phenomena, yet we note that there may be more adequate ways to treat supersegmental phenomena assuming Word-Based morphology as we explore in (Tsarfaty and Goldberg, 2008). Lexical and Morphological Ambiguity The rich morphological processes for deriving Hebrew stems give rise to a high degree of ambiguity for Hebrew space-delimited tokens. Tsarfaty and Sima&#8217;an (2007) have reported state-of-the-art results on Hebrew unlexicalized parsing (74.41%) albeit assuming oracle morphological segmentation. A Single Generative Model for Joint Morphological Segmentation and Syntactic Parsin. Using a treebank grammar, a data-driven lexicon, and a linguistically motivated unknown-tokens handling technique our model outperforms previous pipelined, integrated or factorized systems for Hebrew morphological and syntactic processing, yielding an error reduction of 12% over the best published results so far. Tsarfaty (2006) argues that for Semitic languages determining the correct morphological segmentation is dependent on syntactic context and shows that increasing information sharing between the morphological and the syntactic components leads to improved performance on the joint task. A possible probabilistic model for assigning probabilities to complex analyses of a surface form may be and indeed recent sequential disambiguation models for Hebrew (Adler and Elhadad,
