To model this we treat the labeling of the edges ( i , j1 ) , ... The first stage of our system creates an unlabeled parse y for an input sentence x . These results show that the discriminative spanning tree parsing framework ( McDonald et al. , 2005b ; McDonald and Pereira , 2006 ) is easily adapted across all these languages . This system is primarily based on the parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira ( 2006 ) . In this paper we describe a two-stage discriminative parsing approach consisting of an unlabeled parser and a subsequent edge labeler . The first stage based on the unlabeled dependency parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira ( 2006 ) augmented with morphological features for a subset of the languages . This system is primarily based on the parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira ( 2006 ) . We then add to the representation of the edge : Mi as head features , Mj as dependent features , and also each conjunction of a feature from both sets . The second stage takes the output from the first and labels all the edges in the dependency graph with appropriate syntactic categories using a globally trained sequence classifier over components of the graph . This system is primarily based on the parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira ( 2006 ) . We report results on the CoNLL-X shared task ( Buchholz et al. , 2006 ) data
