In the next section , we show how an ATM can accept the strings generated by a grammar in a LCFRS formalism in logspace , and hence show that each family can be recognized in polynomial time . The independence of paths in a tree set appears to be an important property . Giving a recognition algorithm for LCFRL\ 's involves describing the substrings of the input that are spanned by the structures derived by the LCFRS\ 's and how the composition operation combines these substrings . Giving a recognition algorithm for LCFRL\ 's involves describing the substrings of the input that are spanned by the structures derived by the LCFRS\ 's and how the composition operation combines these substrings . In the next section , we show how an ATM can accept the strings generated by a grammar in a LCFRS formalism in logspace , and hence show that each family can be recognized in polynomial time . In considering this aspect of a formalism , we hope to better understand the relationship between the structural descriptions generated by the grammars of a formalism , and the properties of semilinearity and polynomial recognizability . from this pumping lemma : a single path can be pumped independently . These systems are similar to those described by Pollard ( 1984 ) as Generalized Context-Free Grammars ( GCFG\ 's ) . from this pumping lemma : a single path can be pumped independently .
