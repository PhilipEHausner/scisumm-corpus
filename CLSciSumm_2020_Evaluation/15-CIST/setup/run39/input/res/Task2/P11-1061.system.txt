Unsupervised learning approaches appear to be a natural solution to this problem , as they require only unannotated text for training models . The feature-HMM model works better for all languages , generalizing the results achieved for English by Berg-Kirkpatrick et al . Our results suggest that it is possible to learn accurate POS taggers for languages which do not have any annotated data , but have translations into a resource-rich language . 167 ; 3 , we use two types of vertices in our graph : on the foreign language side vertices correspond to trigram types , while the vertices on the English side are individual word types . To bridge this gap , we consider a practically motivated scenario , in which we want to leverage existing resources from a resource-rich language ( like English ) when building tools for resource-poor foreign languages.1 We assume that absolutely no labeled training data is available for the foreign language of interest , but that we have access to parallel data with a resource-rich language . The focus of this work is on building POS taggers for foreign languages , assuming that we have an English POS tagger and some parallel text between the two languages . ( 2009 ) study related but different multilingual grammar and tagger induction tasks , where it is assumed that no labeled data at all is available . For each trigram type x2 x3 x4 in a sequence x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 , we
