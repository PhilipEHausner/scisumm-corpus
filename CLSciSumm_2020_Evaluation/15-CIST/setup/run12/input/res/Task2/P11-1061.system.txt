Given the bilingual graph described in the previous section , we can use label propagation to project the English POS labels to the foreign language . The edge weights between the foreign language trigrams are computed using a co-occurence based similarity function , designed to indicate how syntactically similar the middle words of the connected trigrams are ( & # 167 ; 3.2 ) . Second , we treat the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model ( & # 167 ; 5 ) , rather than using them directly for supervised training . We were intentionally lenient with our baselines : bilingual information by projecting POS tags directly across alignments in the parallel data . Unsupervised learning approaches appear to be a natural solution to this problem , as they require only unannotated text for training models . ( 2010 ) . We were intentionally lenient with our baselines : bilingual information by projecting POS tags directly across alignments in the parallel data . Our results suggest that it is possible to learn accurate POS taggers for languages which do not have any annotated data , but have translations into a resource-rich language . ( 2010 ) . ( 2010 ) . Given the bilingual graph described in the previous section , we can use label propagation to project the English POS labels to the foreign language . Second , we treat the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model ( & # 167 ; 5 )
