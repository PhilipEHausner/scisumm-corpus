Unsupervised Models for Named Entity Classification Collin . ( Yarowsky 95 ) describes an algorithm for word-sense disambiguation that exploits redundancy in contextual features , and gives impressive performance . Future work should also extend the approach to build a complete named entity extractor - a method that pulls proper names from text and then classifies them . In principle a feature could be an arbitrary predicate of the ( spelling , context ) pair ; for reasons that will become clear , features are limited to querying either the spelling or context alone . Future work should also extend the approach to build a complete named entity extractor - a method that pulls proper names from text and then classifies them . The first method builds on results from ( Yarowsky 95 ) and ( Blum and Mitchell 98 ) . In this work we extended the AdaBoost.MH ( Schapire and Singer 98 ) algorithm to the cotraining case . Frank as a person , Steptoe & amp ; Johnson as a company , and Honduras as a location . AdaBoost was first introduced in ( Freund and Schapire 97 ) ; ( Schapire and Singer 98 ) gave a generalization of AdaBoost which we will use in this paper . The task is to learn a function from an input string ( proper name ) to its type , which we will assume to be one of the categories Person , Organization , or Location . The second
