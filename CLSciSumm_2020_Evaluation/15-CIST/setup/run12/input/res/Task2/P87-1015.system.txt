For example , the MCTAG shown in Figure 7 generates trees of the form shown in Figure 4b . their strong generative capacity . An extension of the TAG system was introduced by Joshi et al . their strong generative capacity . In the next section , we show how an ATM can accept the strings generated by a grammar in a LCFRS formalism in logspace , and hence show that each family can be recognized in polynomial time . Some of the operations will be constant functions , corresponding to elementary structures , and will be written as f ( ) = zi ) , where each z , is a constant , the string of terminal symbols al an , , , . Much of the study of grammatical systems in computational linguistics has been focused on the weak generative capacity of grammatical formalism . find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by Context-Free Grammars On the basis of this observation , we describe a class of formalisms which we call Linear Context- Free Rewriting Systems , and show they are recognizable in polynomial time and generate only semilinear languages . As is described in Section 4 , the property of having a derivation tree set that is a local set appears to be useful in showing important properties of the languages generated by the formalisms . In
