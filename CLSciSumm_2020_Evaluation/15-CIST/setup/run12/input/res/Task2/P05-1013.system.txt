Here we use a slightly different notion of lift , applying to individual arcs and moving their head upwards one step at a time : Intuitively , lifting an arc makes the word wk dependent on the head wi of its original head wj ( which is unique in a well-formed dependency graph ) , unless wj is a root in which case the operation is undefined ( but then wj & # 8212 ; * wk is necessarily projective if the dependency graph is well-formed ) .
