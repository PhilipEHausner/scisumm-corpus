Sentences annotated in previous steps are used as training material for further processing . Since the combinatorics of syntactic constructions creates a. In light of these facts , serious difficulties can be expected arising from the structural component of the existing formalisms . The tree resembles traditional constituent structures . Corpora annotated with syntactic structures are commonly referred to as trctbank.5 . The corpus is stored in a SQL database . Since the combinatorics of syntactic constructions creates a. However , there is a trade-off between the granularity of information encoded in the labels and the speed and accuracy of annotation . Since the combinatorics of syntactic constructions creates a. However , there is a trade-off between the granularity of information encoded in the labels and the speed and accuracy of annotation . In light of these facts , serious difficulties can be expected arising from the structural component of the existing formalisms . Consider the German sentence ( 1 ) daran wird ihn Anna erkennen , & amp ; di er weint at-it will him Anna recognise that he cries \'Anna will recognise him at his cry\ ' A sample constituent structure is given below : The fairly short sentence contains three non-local dependencies , marked by co-references between traces and the corresponding nodes .
