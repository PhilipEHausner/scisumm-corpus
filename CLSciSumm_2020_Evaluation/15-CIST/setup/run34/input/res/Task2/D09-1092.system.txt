We use this corpus to explore the ability of the model both to infer similarities between vocabularies in different languages, and to detect differences in topic emphasis between languages. The internet makes it possible for people all over the world to access documents from different cultures, but readers will not be fluent in this wide variety of languages. The polylingual topic model (PLTM) is an extension of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) for modeling polylingual document tuples. Second, because comparable texts may not use exactly the same topics, it becomes crucially important to be able to characterize differences in topic prevalence at the document level (do different languages have different perspectives on the same article?) and at the language-wide level (which topics do particular languages focus on?). Although the PLTM is clearly not a substitute for a machine translation system&#8212;it has no way to represent syntax or even multi-word phrases&#8212;it is clear from the examples in figure 2 that the sets of high probability words in different languages for a given topic are likely to include translations. Although we find that if Wikipedia contains an article on a particular subject in some language, the article will tend to be topically similar to the articles about that subject in other languages, we also find that across the whole collection different languages emphasize topics to different extents. One simple way to achieve this topic alignment is to add a small set of comparable document tuples that provide sufficient &#8220;glue&#8221;
