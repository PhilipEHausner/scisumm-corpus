The following commands are available: The three tagsets used by the annotation tool (for words, phrases, and edges) are variable and are stored together with the corpus. Syntactically annotated corpora of German have been missing until now. We will closely coordinate the further development of our corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation. Since the combinatorics of syntactic constructions creates a. demand for very large corpora., efficiency of annotation is an important. criterion for the success of the developed methodology and tools. Corpora annotated with syntactic structures are commonly referred to as trctbank.5. The development of linguistically interpreted corpora presents a laborious and time-consuming task. The corpus is stored in a SQL database. Due to the frequency of discontinuous constituents in non-configurational languages, the filler-trace mechanism would be used very often, yielding syntactic trees fairly different from the underlying predicate-argument structures. For the implementation, we used Tcl/Tk Version 4.1. Sentences annotated in previous steps are used as training material for further processing. This amount of data suffices as training material to reliably assign the grammatical functions if the user determines the elements of a phrase and its type (step 1 of the list above). A formalism complying with these requirements is described in section 3. In order to reduce their ambiguity potential, rather simple, \'flat\' trees should be employed, while more information can be expressed by a rich system of function labels. This requirement speaks against the traditional sort of dependency trees,
