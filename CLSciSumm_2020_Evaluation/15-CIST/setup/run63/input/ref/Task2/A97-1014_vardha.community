In order to avoid inconsistencies, the corpus is annotated in two stages: basic annotation and nfirtellte714. We distinguish five degrees of automation: So far, about 1100 sentences of our corpus have been annotated. Corpora annotated with syntactic structures are commonly referred to as trctbank.5. Existing treebank annotation schemes exhibit a fairly uniform architecture, as they all have to meet the same basic requirements, namely: Descriptivity: Grammatical phenomena are to be described rather than explained. As for free word order languages, the following features may cause problems: sition between the two poles. The typical treebank architecture is as follows: Structures: A context-free backbone is augmented with trace-filler representations of non-local dependencies. These differences can be illustrated by a comparison with the Penn Treebank annotation scheme. For evaluation, the already annotated sentences were divided into two disjoint sets, one for training (90% of the corpus), the other one for testing (10%). The work reported in this paper aims at providing syntactically annotated corpora (treebanks') for stochastic grammar induction. These differences can be illustrated by a comparison with the Penn Treebank annotation scheme. In the second phase of the project Verbmobil a. treebank for :30,000 German spoken sentences as well as for the same amount of English and Japanese sentences will be created. Consider the German sentence (1) daran wird ihn Anna erkennen, &amp;di er weint at-it will him Anna recognise that he cries 'Anna will recognise him at his cry' A sample constituent structure is given below: The fairly short sentence contains three non-local dependencies, marked by co-references between traces and the corresponding nodes. However, there is a trade-off between the granularity of information encoded in the labels and the speed and accuracy of annotation.
