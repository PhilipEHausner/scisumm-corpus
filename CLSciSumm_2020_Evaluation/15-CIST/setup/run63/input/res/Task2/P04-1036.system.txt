word sense disambiguation the heuristic of choosing the most common sense is extremely powerful because the distribution of the senses of a word is often skewed . This is shown by the results of the English all-words task in SENSEVAL-2 ( Cotton et al. , 1998 ) in figure 1 below , where the first sense is that listed in WordNet for the PoS given by the Penn TreeBank ( Palmer et al. , 2001 ) . We are currently investigating the performance of the first sense heuristic , and this method , for other PoS on SENSEVAL-3 data ( McCarthy et al. , 2004 ) , although not yet with rankings from domain specific corpora . We are currently investigating the performance of the first sense heuristic , and this method , for other PoS on SENSEVAL-3 data ( McCarthy et al. , 2004 ) , although not yet with rankings from domain specific corpora . 3 The experimental results reported here are obtained using IC counts from the BNC corpus . are therefore investigating a method of automatically ranking WordNet senses from raw text . The problem with using the predominant , or first sense heuristic , aside from the fact that it does not take surrounding context into account , is that it assumes some quantity of handtagged data . 3 The experimental results reported here are obtained using IC counts from the BNC corpus . We believe that an automatic means of finding a predominant sense
