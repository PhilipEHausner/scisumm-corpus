Goodman then gives a simple small PCFG with the following property : for every subtree in the training corpus headed by A , the grammar will generate an isomorphic subderivation with probability 1/a . DOP1 combines subtrees from a treebank by means of node-substitution and computes the probability of a tree from the normalized frequencies of the subtrees ( see Section 2 for a full definition ) .

Bod ( 2001 , 2003 ) . This paper showed that a PCFG-reduction of DOP in combination with a new notion of the best parse tree results in fast processing times and very competitive accuracy on the Wall Street Journal treebank . This paper showed that a PCFG-reduction of DOP in combination with a new notion of the best parse tree results in fast processing times and very competitive accuracy on the Wall Street Journal treebank . However , the problem of computing the most probable parse turns out to be NP-hard ( Sima\'an 1996 ) , mainly because the same parse tree can be generated by exponentially many derivations . The distinctive feature of the DOP approach when it was proposed in 1992 was to model sentence structures on the basis of previously observed frequencies of sentence structure fragments , without imposing any constraints on the size
