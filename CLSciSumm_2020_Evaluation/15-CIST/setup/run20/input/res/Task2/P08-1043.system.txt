This is by now a fairly standard representation for multiple morphological segmentation of Hebrew utterances ( Adler , 2001 ; Bar-Haim et al. , 2005 ; Smith et al. , 2005 ; Cohen and Smith , 2007 ; Adler , 2007 ) . This is by now a fairly standard representation for multiple morphological segmentation of Hebrew utterances ( Adler , 2001 ; Bar-Haim et al. , 2005 ; Smith et al. , 2005 ; Cohen and Smith , 2007 ; Adler , 2007 ) .

Cohen and Smith ( 2007 ) followed up on these results and proposed a system for joint inference of morphological and syntactic structures using factored models each designed and trained on its own . Sima & Our parsing performance measures ( SY N ) thus report the PARSEVAL extension proposed in Tsarfaty ( 2006 ) . Our use of an unweighted lattice reflects our belief that all the segmentations of the given input sentence are a-priori equally likely ; the only reason to prefer
