In this paper we describe and evaluate a method for ranking senses of nouns to obtain the predominant sense of a word using the neighbours from automatically acquired thesauruses . word sense disambiguation the heuristic of choosing the most common sense is extremely powerful because the distribution of the senses of a word is often skewed . word sense disambiguation the heuristic of choosing the most common sense is extremely powerful because the distribution of the senses of a word is often skewed . In this paper we describe and evaluate a method for ranking senses of nouns to obtain the predominant sense of a word using the neighbours from automatically acquired thesauruses . In contrast , we use the neighbours lists and WordNet similarity measures to impose a prevalence ranking on the WordNet senses . We then use the WordNet similarity package ( Patwardhan and Pedersen , 2003 ) to give us a semantic similarity measure ( hereafter referred to as the WordNet similarity measure ) to weight the contribution that each neighbour makes to the various senses of the target word . We have restricted ourselves to nouns in this work , since this PoS is perhaps most affected by domain . Whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense-tagged corpus such as SemCor is clearly useful , there is a strong case for obtaining a first , or predominant , sense from untagged corpus data so that a WSD system can be tuned to the genre
