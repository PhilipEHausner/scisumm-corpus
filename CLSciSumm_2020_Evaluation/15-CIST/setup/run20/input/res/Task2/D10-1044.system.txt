Discriminative Instance Weighting for Domain Adaptation in Statistical Machine Translatio . ) , which precludes a single universal approach to adaptation . Our second contribution is to apply instance weighting at the level of phrase pairs . We will also directly compare with a baseline similar to the Matsoukas et al approach in order to measure the benefit from weighting phrase pairs ( or ngrams ) rather than full sentences . First , we learn weights on individual phrase pairs rather than sentences . Sentence pairs are the natural instances for SMT , but sentences often contain a mix of domain-specific and general language . The matching sentence pairs are then added to the IN corpus , and the system is re-trained . This is a standard adaptation problem for SMT . There has also been some work on adapting the word alignment model prior to phrase extraction ( Civera and Juan , 2007 ; Wu et al. , 2005 ) , and on dynamically choosing a dev set ( Xu et al. , 2007 ) . Although these authors report better gains than ours , they are with respect to a non-adapted baseline . There has also been some work on adapting the word alignment model prior to phrase extraction ( Civera and Juan , 2007 ; Wu et al. , 2005 ) , and on dynamically choosing a dev set ( Xu et al. , 2007 ) . 8212 ; we used the IN dev set for this
