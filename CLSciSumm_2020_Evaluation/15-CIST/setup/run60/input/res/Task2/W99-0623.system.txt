Lemma : If the number of votes required by constituent voting is greater than half of the parsers under consideration the resulting structure has no crossing constituents . We would like to thank Eugene Charniak , Michael Collins , and Adwait Ratnaparkhi for enabling all of this research by providing us with their parsers and helpful comments . The standard measures for evaluating Penn Treebank parsing performance are precision and recall of the predicted constituents . We have developed a general approach for combining parsers when preserving the entire structure of a parse tree is important . The standard measures for evaluating Penn Treebank parsing performance are precision and recall of the predicted constituents . It is possible one could produce better models by introducing features describing constituents and their contexts because one parser could be much better than the majority of the others in particular situations . We would like to thank Eugene Charniak , Michael Collins , and Adwait Ratnaparkhi for enabling all of this research by providing us with their parsers and helpful comments . Similar advances have been made in machine translation ( Frederking and Nirenburg , 1994 ) , speech recognition ( Fiscus , 1997 ) and named entity recognition ( Borthwick et al. , 1998 ) . For our experiments we also report the mean of precision and recall , which we denote by ( P + R ) I2 and F-measure . In Equations 1 through 3 we develop the model for constructing
