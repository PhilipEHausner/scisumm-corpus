This has led previous workers to adopt ad hoc linear weighting schemes ( Finch and Sumita , 2008 ; Foster and Kuhn , 2007 ; L & # 168 ; u et al. , 2007 ) . We describe a new approach to SMT adaptation that weights out-of-domain phrase pairs according to their relevance to the target domain , determined by both how similar to it they appear to be , and whether they belong to general language or not . 8220 ; hidden & 955 ; ( s , t ) is a modified count for pair ( s , t ) in OUT , u ( s|t ) is a prior distribution , and y is a prior weight . 8212 ; we used the IN dev set for this . 955 ; ( s , t ) is a modified count for pair ( s , t ) in OUT , u ( s|t ) is a prior distribution , and y is a prior weight . Compared to the EMEA/EP setting , the two domains in the NIST setting are less homogeneous and more similar to each other ; there is also considerably more IN text available . Discriminative Instance Weighting for Domain Adaptation in Statistical Machine Translatio . Our second contribution is to apply instance weighting at the level of phrase pairs . It is difficult to directly compare the Matsoukas et al results with ours , since our out-of-domain corpus is homogeneous ; given
