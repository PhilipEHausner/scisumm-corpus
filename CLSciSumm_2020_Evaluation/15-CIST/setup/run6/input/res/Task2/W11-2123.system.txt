Many packages perform language model queries . The binary language model from Section 5.2 and text phrase table were forced into disk cache before each run . If the context wnf will never extend to the right ( i.e . wnf v is not present in the model for all words v ) then no subsequent query will match the full context . Performance improvements transfer to the Moses ( Koehn et al. , 2007 ) , cdec ( Dyer et al. , 2010 ) , and Joshua ( Li et al. , 2009 ) translation systems where our code has been integrated . The returned state s ( wn1 ) may then be used in a followon query p ( wn+1js ( wn1 ) ) that extends the previous query by one word . KenLM : Faster and Smaller Language Model Querie . This differs from other implementations ( Stolcke , 2002 ; Pauls and Klein , 2011 ) that use hash tables as nodes in a trie , as explained in the next section .
