Cohen and Smith ( 2007 ) followed up on these results and proposed a system for joint inference of morphological and syntactic structures using factored models each designed and trained on its own .

Our use of an unweighted lattice reflects our belief that all the segmentations of the given input sentence are a-priori equally likely ; the only reason to prefer one segmentation over the another is due to the overall syntactic context which is modeled via the PCFG derivations .

Using a wide-coverage morphological analyzer based on ( Itai et al. , 2006 ) should cater for a better coverage , and incorporating lexical probabilities learned from a big ( unannotated ) corpus ( cf . We first make use of our morphological analyzer to find all segmentation possibilities by chopping off all prefix sequence possibilities ( including the empty prefix ) and construct a lattice off of them .
