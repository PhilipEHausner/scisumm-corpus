Independence of paths at this level reflects context freeness of rewriting and suggests why they can be recognized efficiently. In addition, the restricted version of CG's (discussed in Section 6) generates tree sets with independent paths and we hope that it can be included in a more general definition of LCFRS's containing formalisms whose tree sets have path sets that are themselves LCFRL's (as in the case of the restricted indexed grammars, and the hierarchy defined by Weir). Since every CFL is known to be semilinear (Parikh, 1966), in order to show semilinearity of some language, we need only show the existence of a letter equivalent CFL Our definition of LCFRS's insists that the composition operations are linear and nonerasing. It is interesting to note, however, that the ability to produce a bounded number of dependent paths (where two dependent paths can share an unbounded amount of information) does not require machinery as powerful as that used in LFG, FUG and IG's. We now turn our attention to the recognition of string languages generated by these formalisms (LCFRL's). However, in order to capture the properties of various grammatical systems under consideration, our notation is more restrictive that ILFP, which was designed as a general logical notation to characterize the complete class of languages that are recognizable in polynomial time. Gazdar (1985) argues this is the appropriate analysis of unbounded dependencies in the hypothetical Scandinavian language Norwedish. He also argues that paired English complementizers may also require structural descriptions whose path sets have nested dependencies. Giving a recognition algorithm for LCFRL's involves describing the substrings of the input that are spanned by the structures derived by the LCFRS's and how the composition operation combines these substrings. Members of LCFRS whose operations have this property can be translated into the ILFP notation (Rounds, 1985). An IG can be viewed as a CFG in which each nonterminal is associated with a stack. As in the case of the derivation trees of CFG's, nodes are labeled by a member of some finite set of symbols (perhaps only implicit in the grammar as in TAG's) used to denote derived structures. In considering the recognition of these languages, we were forced to be more specific regarding the relationship between the structures derived by these formalisms and the substrings they span. From Thatcher's (1973) work, it is obvious that the complexity of the set of paths from root to frontier of trees in a local set (the tree set of a CFG) is regular'. LCFRS's share several properties possessed by the class of mildly context-sensitive formalisms discussed by Joshi (1983/85). TAG's can be used to give the structural descriptions discussed by Gazdar (1985) for the unbounded nested dependencies in Norwedish, for cross serial dependencies in Dutch subordinate clauses, and for the nestings of paired English complementizers.
