This differs from other implementations ( Stolcke , 2002 ; Pauls and Klein , 2011 ) that use hash tables as nodes in a trie , as explained in the next section . The PROBING model was designed to improve upon SRILM by using linear probing hash tables ( though not arranged in a trie ) , allocating memory all at once ( eliminating the need for full pointers ) , and being easy to compile . The PROBING model was designed to improve upon SRILM by using linear probing hash tables ( though not arranged in a trie ) , allocating memory all at once ( eliminating the need for full pointers ) , and being easy to compile . This makes memory usage comparable to our PROBING model . Language models are widely applied in natural language processing , and applications such as machine translation make very frequent queries . KenLM : Faster and Smaller Language Model Querie . BerkeleyLM revision 152 ( Pauls and Klein , 2011 ) implements tries based on hash tables and sorted arrays in Java with lossy quantization . IRSTLM ( Federico et al. , 2008 ) is an open-source toolkit for building and querying language models . Performance improvements transfer to the Moses ( Koehn et al. , 2007 ) , cdec ( Dyer et al. , 2010 ) , and Joshua ( Li et al. , 2009 ) translation systems where our code has been integrated . This makes memory usage
