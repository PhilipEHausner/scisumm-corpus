This system is primarily based on the parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006). That work extends the maximum spanning tree dependency parsing framework (McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald et al., 2005b) to incorporate features over multiple edges in the dependency graph. These results show that the discriminative spanning tree parsing framework (McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) is easily adapted across all these languages. We have presented results showing that the spanning tree dependency parsing framework of McDonald et al. (McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) generalizes well to languages other than English. The first stage based on the unlabeled dependency parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006) augmented with morphological features for a subset of the languages. Furthermore, it made the system homogeneous in terms of learning algorithms since that is what is used to train our unlabeled parser (McDonald and Pereira, 2006). Furthermore, these results show that a twostage system can achieve a relatively high performance. In fact, for every language our models perform significantly higher than the average performance for all the systems reported in Buchholz et al. (2006). Similar improvements are common across all languages, though not as dramatic. Even with this improvement, the labeling of verb dependents remains the highest source of error. We report results on the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz et al., 2006) data sets and present an error analysis. We use the MIRA online learner to set the weights (Crammer and Singer, 2003; McDonald et
