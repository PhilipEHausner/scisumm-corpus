The probability of a parse tree T is the sum of the probabilities of its distinct derivations. This means that summing up over derivations of a tree in DOP yields the same probability as summing over all the isomorphic derivations in the PCFG. But Goodman shows that with his PCFG-reduction he can efficiently compute the aforementioned maximum constituents parse. The derivation with the smallest sum, or highest rank, is taken as the final best derivation producing the best parse tree in Simplicity-DOP.3 Although Bod (2000b) reports that Simplicity DOP is outperformed by Likelihood-DOP, its results are still rather impressive for such a simple model. Together with a PCFGreduction of DOP we obtain improved accuracy and efficiency on the Wall Street Journal treebank Our results show an 11% relative reduction in error rate over previous models, and an average processing time of 3.6 seconds per WSJ sentence. Although Bod\'s method obtains very competitive results on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) task, the parsing time was reported to be over 200 seconds per sentence (Bod 2003). Collins &amp; Duffy (2002) showed how the perceptron algorithm can be used to efficiently compute the best parse with DOP1\'s subtrees, reporting a 5.1% relative reduction in error rate over the model in Collins (1999) on the WSJ. Goodman (2002) furthermore showed how Bonnema et al. \'s (1999) and Bod\'s (2001) estimators can be incorporated in his PCFGreduction, but did not report any experiments with these reductions. While Bod (2001) needed to use a very large
