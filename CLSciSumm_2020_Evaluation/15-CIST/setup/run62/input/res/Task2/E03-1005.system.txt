Johnson ( 1998b , 2002 ) showed that DOP1\ 's subtree estimation method is statistically biased and inconsistent . Many implementations of DOP1 therefore estimate the most probable parse by Monte Carlo techniques ( Bod 1998 ; Chappelier & amp ; Rajman 2000 ) , or by Viterbi n-best search ( Bod 2001 ) , or by restricting the set of subtrees ( Sima\'an 1999 ; Chappelier et al . 2002 ) . Yet , his grammar contains more than 5 million subtrees and processing times of over 200 seconds per WSJ sentence are reported ( Bod 2003 ) . Johnson ( 1998b , 2002 ) showed that DOP1\ 's subtree estimation method is statistically biased and inconsistent . Johnson ( 1998b , 2002 ) showed that DOP1\ 's subtree estimation method is statistically biased and inconsistent . Most previous notions of best parse tree in DOP1 were based on a probabilistic metric , with Bod ( 2000b ) as a notable exception , who used a simplicity metric based on the shortest derivation . Let r ( t ) return the root label of t : The probability of a derivation ti0 ... In Bod ( 2000b ) , an alternative notion for the best parse tree was proposed based on a simplicity criterion : instead of producing the most probable tree , this model produced the tree generated by the shortest derivation with the fewest training subtrees . That is , the probability of a subtree t is
