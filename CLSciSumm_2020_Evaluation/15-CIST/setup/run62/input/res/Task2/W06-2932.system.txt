Furthermore , it made the system homogeneous in terms of learning algorithms since that is what is used to train our unlabeled parser ( McDonald and Pereira , 2006 ) . This system is primarily based on the parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira ( 2006 ) .

Of course , we have to define a set of suitable features . We Proceedings of the 10th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning ( CoNLL-X ) , pages 216 & We have presented results showing that the spanning tree dependency parsing framework of McDonald et al . We report results on the CoNLL-X shared task ( Buchholz et al. , 2006 ) data sets and present an error analysis . These results show that the discriminative spanning tree parsing framework ( McDonald et al. , 2005b ; McDonald and Pereira , 2006 ) is easily adapted across all these languages .
