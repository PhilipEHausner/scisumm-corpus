239 ; ve Bayes classifier to determine which constituents to include in the parse . None of the models we have presented utilize features associated with a particular constituent ( i.e . the label , span , parent label , etc . ) to influence parser preference . 239 ; ve Bayes classifier to determine which constituents to include in the parse . Mi ( c ) is a binary function returning t when parser i ( from among the k parsers ) suggests constituent c should be in the parse . 239 ; ve Bayes classifier to determine which constituents to include in the parse . None of the models we have presented utilize features associated with a particular constituent ( i.e . the label , span , parent label , etc . ) to influence parser preference . Lemma : If the number of votes required by constituent voting is greater than half of the parsers under consideration the resulting structure has no crossing constituents . 239 ; ve Bayes constituent combination techniques are guaranteed to produce sets of constituents with no crossing brackets . The average individual parser accuracy was reduced by more than 5 % when we added this new parser , but the precision of the constituent voting technique was the only result that decreased significantly . We have presented two general approaches to studying parser combination : parser switching and parse hybridization . In Equations 1 through 3 we develop the model for constructing
