Because generative statistical models had already proven successful for each of the first three stages , we were optimistic that some of their properties & Our integrated model represents syntax and semantics jointly using augmented parse trees . For the following example , the The Template Relations ( TR ) task involves identifying instances of three relations in the text : TR builds on TE in that TR reports binary relations between elements of TE . Because generative statistical models had already proven successful for each of the first three stages , we were optimistic that some of their properties & Our integrated model represents syntax and semantics jointly using augmented parse trees . Our integrated model represents syntax and semantics jointly using augmented parse trees . Since 1995 , a few statistical parsing algorithms ( Magerman , 1995 ; Collins , 1996 and 1997 ; Charniak , 1997 ; Rathnaparki , 1997 ) demonstrated a breakthrough in parsing accuracy , as measured against the University of Pennsylvania TREEBANK as a gold standard . Almost all approaches to information extraction & Instead , our parsing algorithm , trained on the UPenn TREEBANK , was run on the New York Times source to create unsupervised syntactic training which was constrained to be consistent with semantic annotation . This simple semantic annotation was the only source of task knowledge used to configure the model . We were already using a generative statistical model for part-of-speech tagging ( Weischedel et al . 1993
