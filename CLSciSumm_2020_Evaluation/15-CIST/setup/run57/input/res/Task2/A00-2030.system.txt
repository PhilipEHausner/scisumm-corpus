To produce a corpus of augmented parse trees , we used the following multi-step training procedure which exploited the Penn TREEBANK Applying this procedure yielded a new version of the semantically annotated corpus , now annotated with complete augmented trees like that in Figure 3 . This simple semantic annotation was the only source of task knowledge used to configure the model . To produce a corpus of augmented parse trees , we used the following multi-step training procedure which exploited the Penn TREEBANK Applying this procedure yielded a new version of the semantically annotated corpus , now annotated with complete augmented trees like that in Figure 3 . Word features are introduced primarily to help with unknown words , as in ( Weischedel et al . 1993 ) . In this section , we describe the algorithm that was used to automatically produce augmented trees , starting with a ) human-generated semantic annotations and b ) machinegenerated syntactic parse trees . Because generative statistical models had already proven successful for each of the first three stages , we were optimistic that some of their properties & Because generative statistical models had already proven successful for each of the first three stages , we were optimistic that some of their properties & 8212 ; are based on the divide-and-conquer strategy of reducing a complex problem to a set of simpler ones . 8212 ; are based on the divide-and-conquer strategy of reducing a complex problem to a set of simpler
