( Levinger et al. , 1995 ; Goldberg et al. , ; Adler et al. , 2008 ) ) will make the parser more robust and suitable for use in more realistic scenarios . Here we propose a single joint model for performing both morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation which bypasses the associated circularity . There , a lattice is used to represent the possible sentences resulting from an interpretation of an acoustic model . Here we push the single-framework conjecture across the board and present a single model that performs morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation in a fully generative framework . sults . Here we propose a single joint model for performing both morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation which bypasses the associated circularity . ( Levinger et al. , 1995 ; Goldberg et al. , ; Adler et al. , 2008 ) ) will make the parser more robust and suitable for use in more realistic scenarios . Tsarfaty ( 2006 ) used a morphological analyzer ( Segal , 2000 ) , a PoS tagger ( Bar-Haim et al. , 2005 ) , and a general purpose parser ( Schmid , 2000 ) in an integrated framework in which morphological and syntactic components interact to share information , leading to improved performance on the joint task . Here we propose a single joint model for performing both morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation which bypasses the associated circularity . Tsarfaty ( 2006 ) used a morphological analyzer ( Segal ,
