The Expectation Maximization ( EM ) algorithm ( Dempster , Laird and Rubin 77 ) is a common approach for unsupervised training ; in this section we describe its application to the named entity problem . The CoBoost algorithm just described is for the case where there are two labels : for the named entity task there are three labels , and in general it will be useful to generalize the CoBoost algorithm to the multiclass case . A contextual rule considers words surrounding the string in the sentence in which it appears ( e.g. , a rule that any proper name modified by an appositive whose head is president is a person ) . 8212 ; this deserves more theoretical investigation . This paper discusses the use of unlabeled examples for the problem of named entity classification . Future work should also extend the approach to build a complete named entity extractor - a method that pulls proper names from text and then classifies them . For a description of the application of AdaBoost to various NLP problems see the paper by Abney , Schapire , and Singer in this volume . This paper discusses the use of unlabeled examples for the problem of named entity classification . Future work should also extend the approach to build a complete named entity extractor - a method that pulls proper names from text and then classifies them . Our derivation is slightly different from the one presented in ( Schapire and
