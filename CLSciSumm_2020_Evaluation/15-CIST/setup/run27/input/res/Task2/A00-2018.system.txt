As the generative model is top-down and we use a standard bottom-up best-first probabilistic chart parser [ 2,7 ] , we use the chart parser as a first pass to generate candidate possible parses to be evaluated in the second pass by our probabilistic model . The results of [ 13 ] achieved by combining the aforementioned three-best parsers also suggest that the limit on tree-bank trained parsers is much higher than previously thought . The author would like to thank Mark Johnson and all the rest of the Brown Laboratory for Linguistic Information Processing . The model assigns a probability to a parse by a top-down process of considering each constituent c in Ir and for each c first guessing the pre-terminal of c , t ( c ) ( t for & amp ; quot ; tag & amp ; quot ; ) , then the lexical head of c , h ( c ) , and then the expansion of c into further constituents e ( c ) .
