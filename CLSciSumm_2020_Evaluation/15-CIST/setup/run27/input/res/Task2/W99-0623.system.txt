We then show that the combining techniques presented above give better parsing accuracy than any of the individual parsers . The set is then compared with the set generated from the Penn Treebank parse to determine the precision and recall . If the parse contains productions from outside our grammar the machine has no direct method for handling them ( e.g . the resulting database query may be syntactically malformed ) . We then show that the combining techniques presented above give better parsing accuracy than any of the individual parsers . Adding the isolated constituents to our hypothesis parse could increase our expected recall , but in the cases we investigated it would invariably hurt our precision more than we would gain on recall . We then show that the combining techniques presented above give better parsing accuracy than any of the individual parsers . Because we are working with only three parsers , the only situation in which context will help us is when it can indicate we should choose to believe a single parser that disagrees with the majority hypothesis instead of the majority hypothesis itself . Adding the isolated constituents to our hypothesis parse could increase our expected recall , but in the cases we investigated it would invariably hurt our precision more than we would gain on recall .
