8593 ; h for each lifted arc , where d is the dependency relation between the syntactic head and the dependent in the non-projective representation , and h is the dependency relation that the syntactic head has to its own head in the underlying structure . In section 2 we introduce the graph transformation techniques used to projectivize and deprojectivize dependency graphs , and in section 3 we describe the data-driven dependency parser that is the core of our system . 8593 ; h for each lifted arc , where d is the dependency relation between the syntactic head and the dependent in the non-projective representation , and h is the dependency relation that the syntactic head has to its own head in the underlying structure . 8727 ; wj holds in the original graph . Prague Dependency Treebank ( Haji & # 711 ; c et al. , 2001b ) , Danish Dependency Treebank ( Kromann , 2003 ) , and the METU Treebank of Turkish ( Oflazer et al. , 2003 ) , which generally allow annotations with nonprojective dependency structures . 8727 ; wj holds in the original graph . Experiments using data from the Prague Dependency Treebank show that the combined system can handle nonprojective constructions with a precision sufficient to yield a significant improvement in overall parsing accuracy . In section 2 we introduce the graph transformation techniques used to projectivize and deprojectivize dependency graphs , and in section 3 we describe the data-driven dependency
