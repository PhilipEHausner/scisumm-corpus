Here we propose a single joint model for performing both morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation which bypasses the associated circularity . The current work treats both segmental and super-segmental phenomena , yet we note that there may be more adequate ways to treat supersegmental phenomena assuming Word-Based morphology as we explore in ( Tsarfaty and Goldberg , 2008 ) . These words are in turn highly ambiguous , breaking the assumption underlying most parsers that the yield of a tree for a given sentence is known in advance .

Morphological segmentation decisions in our model are delegated to a lexeme-based PCFG and we show that using a simple treebank grammar , a data-driven lexicon , and a linguistically motivated unknown-tokens handling our model outperforms ( Tsarfaty , 2006 ) and ( Cohen and Smith , 2007 ) on the joint task and achieves state-of-the-art results on a par with current respective standalone models.. 960 ; selects a specific
