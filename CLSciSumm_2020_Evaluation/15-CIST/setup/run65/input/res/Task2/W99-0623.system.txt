In Equations 1 through 3 we develop the model for constructing our parse using na & In this case we are interested in finding\ ' the maximum probability parse , ri , and Mi is the set of relevant ( binary ) parsing decisions made by parser i. This is the only important case , because otherwise the simple majority combining technique would pick the correct constituent . Recently , combination techniques have been investigated for part of speech tagging with positive results ( van Halteren et al. , 1998 ; Brill and Wu , 1998 ) . One can trivially create situations in which strictly binary-branching trees are combined to create a tree with only the root node and the terminal nodes , a completely flat structure . This is the only important case , because otherwise the simple majority combining technique would pick the correct constituent . One hybridization strategy is to let the parsers vote on constituents\ ' membership in the hypothesized set . Recently , combination techniques have been investigated for part of speech tagging with positive results ( van Halteren et al. , 1998 ; Brill and Wu , 1998 ) . For example , one parser could be more accurate at predicting noun phrases than the other parsers . Adding the isolated constituents to our hypothesis parse could increase our expected recall , but in the cases we investigated it would invariably hurt our precision more than we would gain on recall .
