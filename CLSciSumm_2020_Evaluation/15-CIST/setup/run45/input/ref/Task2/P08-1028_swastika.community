Central in these models is the notion of compositionality &#8212; the meaning of complex expressions is determined by the meanings of their constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them. Our results show that the multiplicative models are superior and correlate significantly with behavioral data. In this paper we presented a general framework for vector-based semantic composition.</S We formulate semantic composition as a function of two vectors, u and v. We assume that individual words are represented by vectors acquired from a corpus following any of the parametrisations that have been suggested in the literature.1 We briefly note here that a word&#8217;s vector typically represents its co-occurrence with neighboring words. The models considered so far assume that components do not &#8216;interfere&#8217; with each other, i.e., that It is also possible to re-introduce the dependence on K into the model of vector composition. Let p denote the composition of two vectors u and v, representing a pair of constituents which stand in some syntactic relation R. Let K stand for any additional knowledge or information which is needed to construct the semantics of their composition. We formulated composition as a function of two vectors and introduced several models based on addition and multiplication. To derive specific models from this general framework requires the identification of appropriate constraints to narrow the space of functions being considered. Relaxing the assumption of symmetry in the case of the simple additive model produces a model which weighs the contribution of the two components differently: This allows additive models to become more syntax aware, since semantically important constituents can participate more actively in the composition. In order to establish an independent measure of sentence similarity, we assembled a set of experimental materials and elicited similarity ratings from human subjects. Despite the popularity of additive models, our experimental results showed the superiority of models utilizing multiplicative combinations, at least for the sentence similarity task attempted here.
