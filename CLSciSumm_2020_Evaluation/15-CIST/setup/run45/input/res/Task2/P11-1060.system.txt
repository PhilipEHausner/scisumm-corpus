The logical forms in DCS are called DCS trees , where nodes are labeled with predicates , and edges are labeled with relations . Figure 1 shows our probabilistic model : with respect to a world w ( database of facts ) , producing an answer y . cate scoping in lambda calculus , and often type rais- Acknowledgments We thank Luke Zettlemoyer ing needs to be employed . In this paper , we learn to map questions to answers via latent logical forms , which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs . Table 3 shows that even DCS , which does not use prototypes , is comparable to the best previous system ( Kwiatkowski et al. , 2010 ) , and by adding a few prototypes , DCS+ offers a decisive edge ( 91.1 % over 88.9 % on GEO ) .

Supervised semantic parsers ( Zelle and Mooney , 1996 ; Tang and Mooney , 2001 ; Ge and Mooney , 2005 ; Zettlemoyer and Collins , 2005 ; Kate and Mooney , 2007 ; Zettlemoyer and Collins , 2007 ; Wong and Mooney , 2007 ; Kwiatkowski et al. , 2010 ) rely on manual annotation of logical forms , which is expensive . 8712 ; S } with domain S1 = { x : ( x , y )
