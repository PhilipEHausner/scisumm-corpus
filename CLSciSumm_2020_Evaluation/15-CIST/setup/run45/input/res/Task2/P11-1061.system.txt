8217 ; t have words in common . 8217 ; s state space . We use graph-based label propagation for cross-lingual knowledge transfer and use the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model ( Berg- Kirkpatrick et al. , 2010 ) . Graph construction does not require any labeled data , but makes use of two similarity functions . 8217 ; t have words in common . This formulation of the constraint feature is equivalent to the use of a tagging dictionary extracted from the graph using a threshold T on the posterior distribution of tags for a given word type ( Eq . The function A : F & # 8212 ; * C maps from the language specific fine-grained tagset F to the coarser universal tagset C and is described in detail in & # 167 ; 6.2 : Note that when tx ( y ) = 1 the feature value is 0 and has no effect on the model , while its value is & To bridge this gap , we consider a practically motivated scenario , in which we want to leverage existing resources from a resource-rich language ( like English ) when building tools for resource-poor foreign languages.1 We assume that absolutely no labeled training data is available for the foreign language of interest , but that we have access to parallel data with a resource-rich language . To make the projection practical , we rely on the twelve universal part-of-speech tags of Petrov
