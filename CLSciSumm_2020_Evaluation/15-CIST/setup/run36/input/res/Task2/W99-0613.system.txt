Our first algorithm is similar to Yarowsky\ 's , but with some important modifications motivated by ( Blum and Mitchell 98 ) . Our first algorithm is similar to Yarowsky\ 's , but with some important modifications motivated by ( Blum and Mitchell 98 ) . The new algorithm , which we call CoBoost , uses labeled and unlabeled data and builds two classifiers in parallel . This paper discusses the use of unlabeled examples for the problem of named entity classification . The task is to learn a function from an input string ( proper name ) to its type , which we will assume to be one of the categories Person , Organization , or Location . Recent results ( e.g. , ( Yarowsky 95 ; Brill 95 ; Blum and Mitchell 98 ) ) have suggested that unlabeled data can be used quite profitably in reducing the need for supervision . Several extensions of AdaBoost for multiclass problems have been suggested ( Freund and Schapire 97 ; Schapire and Singer 98 ) . The new algorithm , which we call CoBoost , uses labeled and unlabeled data and builds two classifiers in parallel . The first method builds on results from ( Yarowsky 95 ) and ( Blum and Mitchell 98 ) . The approach gains leverage from natural redundancy in the data : for many named-entity instances both the spelling of the name and the context in which it appears are sufficient to determine its type
