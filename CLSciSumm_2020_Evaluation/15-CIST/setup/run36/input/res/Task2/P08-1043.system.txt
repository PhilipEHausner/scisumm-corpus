A Single Generative Model for Joint Morphological Segmentation and Syntactic Parsin . 960 ; s.t . We first make use of our morphological analyzer to find all segmentation possibilities by chopping off all prefix sequence possibilities ( including the empty prefix ) and construct a lattice off of them . 960 ; s.t . We conjecture that this trend may continue by incorporating additional information , e.g. This essentially means that their model does not result in a true joint inference , as executions for different tasks involve tuning a parameter separately . Tsarfaty ( 2006 ) was the first to demonstrate that fully automatic Hebrew parsing is feasible using the newly available 5000 sentences treebank . A Single Generative Model for Joint Morphological Segmentation and Syntactic Parsin . Here we push the single-framework conjecture across the board and present a single model that performs morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation in a fully generative framework . This is by now a fairly standard representation for multiple morphological segmentation of Hebrew utterances ( Adler , 2001 ; Bar-Haim et al. , 2005 ; Smith et al. , 2005 ; Cohen and Smith , 2007 ; Adler , 2007 ) . Morphological segmentation decisions in our model are delegated to a lexeme-based PCFG and we show that using a simple treebank grammar , a data-driven lexicon , and a linguistically motivated unknown-tokens handling our model outperforms ( Tsarfaty , 2006 ) and ( Cohen and Smith , 2007 ) on the joint
