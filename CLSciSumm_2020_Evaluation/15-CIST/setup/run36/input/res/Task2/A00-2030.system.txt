In our statistical model , trees are generated according to a process similar to that described in ( Collins 1996 , 1997 ) . An example of an augmented parse tree is shown in Figure 3 . This simple semantic annotation was the only source of task knowledge used to configure the model . 8212 ; that is , the entities and relations & If the single generalized model could then be extended to semantic analysis , all necessary sentence level processing would be contained in that model . To produce a corpus of augmented parse trees , we used the following multi-step training procedure which exploited the Penn TREEBANK Applying this procedure yielded a new version of the semantically annotated corpus , now annotated with complete augmented trees like that in Figure 3 . Chiba , ( 1999 ) was able to use such a parsing algorithm to reduce perplexity with the long term goal of improved speech recognition . In our statistical model , trees are generated according to a process similar to that described in ( Collins 1996 , 1997 ) . Instead , our parsing algorithm , trained on the UPenn TREEBANK , was run on the New York Times source to create unsupervised syntactic training which was constrained to be consistent with semantic annotation . Goldstein , a historian at the University of Pittsburgh who helped write ... Given multiple constituents that cover identical spans in the chart , only those constituents with probabilities within
