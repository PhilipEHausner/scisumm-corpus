Argument structure can be represented in terms of unordered trees ( with crossing branches ) . Sentences annotated in previous steps are used as training material for further processing . During the second annotation stage , the annotation is enriched with information about thematic roles , quantifier scope and anaphoric reference . Consider the German sentence ( 1 ) daran wird ihn Anna erkennen , & amp ; di er weint at-it will him Anna recognise that he cries \'Anna will recognise him at his cry\ ' A sample constituent structure is given below : The fairly short sentence contains three non-local dependencies , marked by co-references between traces and the corresponding nodes . Due to the frequency of discontinuous constituents in non-configurational languages , the filler-trace mechanism would be used very often , yielding syntactic trees fairly different from the underlying predicate-argument structures . In order to reduce their ambiguity potential , rather simple , \'flat\ ' trees should be employed , while more information can be expressed by a rich system of function labels .
