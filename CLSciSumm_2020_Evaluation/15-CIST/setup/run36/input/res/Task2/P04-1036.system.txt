There has been some related work on using automatic thesauruses for discovering word senses from corpora Pantel and Lin ( 2002 ) . In this paper we describe and evaluate a method for ranking senses of nouns to obtain the predominant sense of a word using the neighbours from automatically acquired thesauruses . To disambiguate senses a system should take context into account . They evaluate using the lin measure described above in section 2.2 to determine the precision and recall of these discovered classes with respect to WordNet synsets . We believe that an automatic means of finding a predominant sense would be useful for systems that use it as a means of backing-off ( Wilks and Stevenson , 1998 ; Hoste et al. , 2001 ) and for systems that use it in lexical acquisition ( McCarthy , 1997 ; Merlo and Leybold , 2001 ; Korhonen , 2002 ) because of the limited size of hand-tagged resources . We are currently investigating the performance of the first sense heuristic , and this method , for other PoS on SENSEVAL-3 data ( McCarthy et al. , 2004 ) , although not yet with rankings from domain specific corpora . Lapata and Brew ( 2004 ) have recently also highlighted the importance of a good prior in WSD . They evaluate using the lin measure described above in section 2.2 to determine the precision and recall of these discovered classes with respect to WordNet synsets . There has been
