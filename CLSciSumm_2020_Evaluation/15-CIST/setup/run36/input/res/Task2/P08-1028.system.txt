Following previous work ( Bullinaria and Levy , 2007 ) , we optimized its parameters on a word-based semantic similarity task . Under this framework , we introduce a wide range of composition models which we evaluate empirically on a sentence similarity task . Despite the popularity of additive models , our experimental results showed the superiority of models utilizing multiplicative combinations , at least for the sentence similarity task attempted here . The results of our correlation analysis are also given in Table 2 . He argues that the subjects of ran in The color ran and The horse ran select different senses of ran . Combining the multiplicative model with an additive model , which does not suffer from this problem , could mitigate this problem : pi = & Finally , Kintsch & This paper proposes a framework for representing the meaning of phrases and sentences in vector space . Under this framework , we introduce a wide range of composition models which we evaluate empirically on a sentence similarity task . The results of our correlation analysis are also given in Table 2 . Combining the multiplicative model with an additive model , which does not suffer from this problem , could mitigate this problem : pi = & Evaluation Methodology We evaluated the proposed composition models in two ways . The results of our correlation analysis are also given in Table 2 . This paper proposes a framework for representing the meaning of phrases and
