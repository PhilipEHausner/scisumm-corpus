Whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense-tagged corpus such as SemCor is clearly useful , there is a strong case for obtaining a first , or predominant , sense from untagged corpus data so that a WSD system can be tuned to the genre or domain at hand . They evaluate using the lin measure described above in section 2.2 to determine the precision and recall of these discovered classes with respect to WordNet synsets . A major benefit of our work , rather than reliance on hand-tagged training data such as SemCor , is that this method permits us to produce predominant senses for the domain and text type required . We present work on the use of a thesaurus acquired from raw textual corpora and the WordNet similarity package to find predominant noun senses automatically . To find the first sense of a word ( ) we take each sense in turn and obtain a score reflecting the prevalence which is used for ranking . The results in table 1 show the accuracy of the ranking with respect to SemCor over the entire set of 2595 polysemous nouns in SemCor with the jcn and lesk WordNet similarity measures . To disambiguate senses a system should take context into account . They evaluate using the lin measure described above in section 2.2 to determine the precision and recall of these discovered classes with respect to WordNet synsets . Even systems which show superior performance to this heuristic
