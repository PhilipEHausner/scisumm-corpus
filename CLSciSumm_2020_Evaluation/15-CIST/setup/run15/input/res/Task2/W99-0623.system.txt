The hypothesized parse is then the set of constituents that are likely ( P & gt ; 0.5 ) to be in the parse according to this model . We used these three parsers to explore parser combination techniques . We show the results of three of the experiments we conducted to measure isolated constituent precision under various partitioning schemes . The first shows how constituent features and context do not help in deciding which parser to trust . We call this technique constituent voting . We used these three parsers to explore parser combination techniques . The second row is the accuracy of the best of the three parsers.\ . The second row is the accuracy of the best of the three parsers.\ . One hybridization strategy is to let the parsers vote on constituents\ ' membership in the hypothesized set . This is the first set that gives us a fair evaluation of the Bayes models , and the Bayes switching model performs significantly better than its non-parametric counterpart . The Bayes models were able to achieve significantly higher precision than their non-parametric counterparts . The second row is the accuracy of the best of the three parsers.\ . For this reason , na & The first shows how constituent features and context do not help in deciding which parser to trust .
