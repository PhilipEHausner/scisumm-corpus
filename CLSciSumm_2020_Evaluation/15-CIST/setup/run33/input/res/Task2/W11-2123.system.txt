The binary language model from Section 5.2 and text phrase table were forced into disk cache before each run . It is generally considered to be fast ( Pauls 29 & # 8722 ; 1 probabilities and 2\ ' & # 8722 ; 2 non-zero backoffs . and Klein , 2011 ) , with a default implementation based on hash tables within each trie node . 8722 ; 1 preceding words . The trie data structure is commonly used for language modeling . Throughout this paper we compare with several packages : SRILM 1.5.12 ( Stolcke , 2002 ) is a popular toolkit based on tries used in several decoders .

Dynamic programming efficiently scores many hypotheses by exploiting the fact that an N-gram language model conditions on at most N & It is generally considered to be fast ( Pauls 29 & # 8722 ; 1 probabilities and 2\ ' & # 8722 ; 2 non-zero backoffs . and Klein , 2011 ) , with a default implementation based on hash tables within each trie node .
