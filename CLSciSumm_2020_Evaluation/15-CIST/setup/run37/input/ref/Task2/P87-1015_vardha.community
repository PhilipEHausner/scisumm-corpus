This class of formalisms have the properties that their derivation trees are local sets, and manipulate objects, using a finite number of composition operations that use a finite number of symbols. In defining LCFRS's, we hope to generalize the definition of CFG's to formalisms manipulating any structure, e.g. strings, trees, or graphs. Much of the study of grammatical systems in computational linguistics has been focused on the weak generative capacity of grammatical formalism. In the remainder of the paper, we outline how a class of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS's) may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows. To show that the derivation trees of any grammar in LCFRS is a local set, we can rewrite the annotated derivation trees such that every node is labelled by a pair to include the composition operations. We can show that languages generated by LCFRS's are semilinear as long as the composition operation does not remove any terminal symbols from its arguments. Giving a recognition algorithm for LCFRL's involves describing the substrings of the input that are spanned by the structures derived by the LCFRS's and how the composition operation combines these substrings. In the remainder of the paper, we outline how a class of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS's) may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows. To show that the derivation trees of any grammar in LCFRS is a local set, we can rewrite the annotated derivation trees such that every node is labelled by a pair to include the composition operations. Although embedding this version of LCFRS's in the framework of ILFP developed by Rounds (1985) is straightforward, our motivation was to capture properties shared by a family of grammatical systems and generalize them defining a class of related formalisms. The similarities become apparent when they are studied at the level of derivation structures: derivation nee sets of CFG's, HG's, TAG's, and MCTAG's are all local sets. We examine both the complexity of the paths of trees in the tree sets, and the kinds of dependencies that the formalisms can impose between paths. A TAG consists of a finite set of elementary trees that are either initial trees or auxiliary trees.
