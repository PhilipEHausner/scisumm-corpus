This system is primarily based on the parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006). That work extends the maximum spanning tree dependency parsing framework (McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald et al., 2005b) to incorporate features over multiple edges in the dependency graph. These results show that the discriminative spanning tree parsing framework (McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) is easily adapted across all these languages. Unfortunately, accuracy for other word types decreases somewhat, resulting in no significant net accuracy change. The first stage based on the unlabeled dependency parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006) augmented with morphological features for a subset of the languages. Performance is measured through unlabeled accuracy, which is the percentage of words that modify the correct head in the dependency graph, and labeled accuracy, which is the percentage of words that modify the correct head and label the dependency edge correctly in the graph. Furthermore, these results show that a twostage system can achieve a relatively high performance. In fact, for every language our models perform significantly higher than the average performance for all the systems reported in Buchholz et al. (2006). Similar improvements are common across all languages, though not as dramatic. Even with this improvement, the labeling of verb dependents remains the highest source of error. We report results on the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz et al., 2006) data sets and present an error analysis. The first stage of our system creates an unlabeled parse y for an input
