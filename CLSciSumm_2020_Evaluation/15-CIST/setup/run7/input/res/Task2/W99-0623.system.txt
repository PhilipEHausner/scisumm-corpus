Three state-of-the-art statistical parsers are combined to produce more accurate parses, as well as new bounds on achievable Treebank parsing accuracy. We then show that the combining techniques presented above give better parsing accuracy than any of the individual parsers. Finally we show the combining techniques degrade very little when a poor parser is added to the set. The first row represents the average accuracy of the three parsers we combine. We call this technique constituent voting. Lemma: If the number of votes required by constituent voting is greater than half of the parsers under consideration the resulting structure has no crossing constituents. IL+-1Proof: Assume a pair of crossing constituents appears in the output of the constituent voting technique using k parsers. In the cases where isolated constituent precision is larger than 0.5 the affected portion of the hypotheses is negligible. We used these three parsers to explore parser combination techniques. If enough parsers suggest that a particular constituent belongs in the parse, we include it. Mi(c) is a binary function returning t when parser i (from among the k parsers) suggests constituent c should be in the parse. We show the results of three of the experiments we conducted to measure isolated constituent precision under various partitioning schemes. Another technique for parse hybridization is to use a na&#239;ve Bayes classifier to determine which constituents to include in the parse. There are simply not enough votes remaining to allow any of the crossing structures to enter the hypothesized constituent set.
