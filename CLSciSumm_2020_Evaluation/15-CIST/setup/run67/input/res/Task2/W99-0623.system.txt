Three state-of-the-art statistical parsers are combined to produce more accurate parses, as well as new bounds on achievable Treebank parsing accuracy. We then show that the combining techniques presented above give better parsing accuracy than any of the individual parsers. Finally we show the combining techniques degrade very little when a poor parser is added to the set. We would like to thank Eugene Charniak, Michael Collins, and Adwait Ratnaparkhi for enabling all of this research by providing us with their parsers and helpful comments. There are simply not enough votes remaining to allow any of the crossing structures to enter the hypothesized constituent set. IL+-1Proof: Assume a pair of crossing constituents appears in the output of the constituent voting technique using k parsers. Similarly Figures 1 and 2 show how the isolated constituent precision varies by sentence length and the size of the span of the hypothesized constituent. The precision and recall of similarity switching and constituent voting are both significantly better than the best individual parser, and constituent voting is significantly better than parser switching in precision.4 Constituent voting gives the highest accuracy for parsing the Penn Treebank reported to date. This technique has the advantage of requiring no training, but it has the disadvantage of treating all parsers equally even though they may have differing accuracies or may specialize in modeling different phenomena. Another technique for parse hybridization is to use a na&#239;ve Bayes classifier to determine which constituents to include in the parse. Because we are
