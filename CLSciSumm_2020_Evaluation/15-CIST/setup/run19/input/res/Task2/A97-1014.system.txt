We describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages. Syntactically annotated corpora of German have been missing until now. We will closely coordinate the further development of our corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation. Since the combinatorics of syntactic constructions creates a. demand for very large corpora., efficiency of annotation is an important. criterion for the success of the developed methodology and tools. An Annotation Scheme for Free Word Order Language. The data-drivenness of this approach presents a clear advantage over the traditional, idealised notion of competence grammar. The following commands are available: The three tagsets used by the annotation tool (for words, phrases, and edges) are variable and are stored together with the corpus. The corpus is stored in a SQL database. The underlying argument SirlteilITC is not represented directly, but can be recovered from the tree and trace-filler annotations. For the implementation, we used Tcl/Tk Version 4.1. Sentences annotated in previous steps are used as training material for further processing. In light of these facts, serious difficulties can be expected arising from the structural component of the existing formalisms. In order to reduce their ambiguity potential, rather simple, \'flat\' trees should be employed, while more information can be expressed by a rich system of function labels. This requirement speaks against the traditional sort of dependency trees, in which heads a,re represented as non-terminal nodes, cf. A tree meeting these requirements is
