We describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part-of-speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language. Unsupervised learning approaches appear to be a natural solution to this problem, as they require only unannotated text for training models. To make the projection practical, we rely on the twelve universal part-of-speech tags of Petrov et al. (2011). For comparison, the completely unsupervised feature-HMM baseline accuracy on the universal POS tags for English is 79.4%, and goes up to 88.7% with a treebank dictionary. However, supervised methods rely on labeled training data, which is time-consuming and expensive to generate. Unfortunately, the best completely unsupervised English POS tagger (that does not make use of a tagging dictionary) reaches only 76.1% accuracy (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2010), making its practical usability questionable at best. The focus of this work is on building POS taggers for foreign languages, assuming that we have an English POS tagger and some parallel text between the two languages. Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Tagging with Bilingual Graph-Based Projection. Our method does not assume any knowledge about the target language (in particular no tagging dictionary is assumed), making it applicable to a wide array of resource-poor languages. The edge weights between the foreign language trigrams are computed using a co-occurence based similarity function, designed to indicate how syntactically similar the middle words of the connected trigrams are (&#167;3.2). They considered a semi-supervised POS tagging scenario and showed that one can use a graph over trigram
