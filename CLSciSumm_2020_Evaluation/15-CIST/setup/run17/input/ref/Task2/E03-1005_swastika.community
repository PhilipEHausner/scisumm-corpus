's (1999) and Bod's (2001) estimators on the WSJ. DOP1 has a serious bias: its subtree estimator provides more probability to nodes with more subtrees (Bonnema et al. 1999).

The highest accuracy is obtained by SL-DOP at 12 n 14: an LP of 90.8% and an LR of 90.7%.

Bod (2000a) solved this problem by training the subtree probabilities by a maximum likelihood procedure based on Expectation-Maximization.
