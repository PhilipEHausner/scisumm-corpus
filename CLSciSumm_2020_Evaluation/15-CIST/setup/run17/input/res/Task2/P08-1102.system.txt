Word segmentation and part-of-speech ( POS ) tagging are important tasks in computer processing of Chinese and other Asian languages . The feature templates we adopted are selected from those of Ng and Low ( 2004 ) . We called them non-lexical-target because predications derived from them can predicate without considering the current character C0 . As a result , many theoretically useful features such as higherorder word or POS n-grams are difficult to be incorporated in the model efficiently . We called them non-lexical-target because predications derived from them can predicate without considering the current character C0 . The perceptron has been used in many NLP tasks , such as POS tagging ( Collins , 2002 ) , Chinese word segmentation ( Ng and Low , 2004 ; Zhang and Clark , 2007 ) and so on . Word segmentation and part-of-speech ( POS ) tagging are important tasks in computer processing of Chinese and other Asian languages . Besides this perceptron , other sub-models are trained and used as additional features of the outside-layer linear model . Word segmentation and part-of-speech ( POS ) tagging are important tasks in computer processing of Chinese and other Asian languages . A Cascaded Linear Model for Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-Speech Taggin . Given a Chinese character sequence C1 : n , the decoding procedure can proceed in a left-right fashion with a dynamic programming approach . Compared to performing segmentation and POS tagging one at a time , Joint
