The work reported in this paper aims at providing syntactically annotated corpora ( treebanks\ ' ) for stochastic grammar induction . Thus , notions such as head should be distinguished at the level of syntactic functions rather than structures . criterion for the success of the developed methodology and tools . A tree meeting these requirements is given below : Adv V NP NP V CPL NP V damn wird ihn Anna erkennen , dais er \'vein . The underlying argument SirlteilITC is not represented directly , but can be recovered from the tree and trace-filler annotations . criterion for the success of the developed methodology and tools . We describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages . We describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages . We describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages . In light of these facts , serious difficulties can be expected arising from the structural component of the existing formalisms . We describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages .
