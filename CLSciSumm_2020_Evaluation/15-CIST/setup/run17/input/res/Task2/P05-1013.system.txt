Before we turn to the evaluation , however , we need to introduce the data-driven dependency parser used in the latter experiments . We show how a datadriven deterministic dependency parser , in itself restricted to projective structures , can be combined with graph transformation techniques to produce non-projective structures . This is true of the widely used link grammar parser for English ( Sleator and Temperley , 1993 ) , which uses a dependency grammar of sorts , the probabilistic dependency parser of Eisner ( 1996 ) , and more recently proposed deterministic dependency parsers ( Yamada and Matsumoto , 2003 ; Nivre et al. , 2004 ) . ( 1998 ) , any ( nonprojective ) dependency graph can be transformed into a projective one by a lifting operation , which replaces each non-projective arc wj wk by a projective arc wi & The overall parsing accuracy obtained with the pseudo-projective approach is still lower than for the best projective parsers . In order to realize the full potential of dependency-based syntactic parsing , it is desirable to allow non-projective dependency structures . This is true of the widely used link grammar parser for English ( Sleator and Temperley , 1993 ) , which uses a dependency grammar of sorts , the probabilistic dependency parser of Eisner ( 1996 ) , and more recently proposed deterministic dependency parsers ( Yamada and Matsumoto , 2003 ; Nivre et al. , 2004 ) . Thus , most broad-coverage parsers based
