According to Ng and Low ( 2004 ) , the segmentation task can be transformed to a tagging problem by assigning each character a boundary tag of the following four types : We can extract segmentation result by splitting the labelled result into subsequences of pattern s or bm*e which denote single-character word and multicharacter word respectively . The evaluation results are shown in Table 3 . Given a Chinese character sequence C1 : n , the decoding procedure can proceed in a left-right fashion with a dynamic programming approach . Word segmentation and part-of-speech ( POS ) tagging are important tasks in computer processing of Chinese and other Asian languages . Instead of incorporating all features into the perceptron directly , we first trained the perceptron using character-based features , and several other sub-models using additional ones such as word or POS n-grams , then trained the outside-layer linear model using the outputs of these sub-models , including the perceptron . At the first step , we conducted a group of contrasting experiments on the core perceptron , the first concentrated on the segmentation regardless of the POS information and reported the F-measure on segmentation only , while the second performed Joint S & amp ; T using POS information and reported the F-measure both on segmentation and on Joint S & amp ; T. Shown in Figure 1 , the cascaded model has a two-layer architecture , with a characterbased perceptron as the core combined with other real-valued
