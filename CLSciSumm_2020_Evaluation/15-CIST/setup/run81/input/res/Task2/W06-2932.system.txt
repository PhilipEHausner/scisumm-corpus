Only Arabic , Turkish and Slovene have parsing accuracies significantly below 80 % , and these languages have relatively small training sets and/or are highly inflected with little to no word order constraints . The first stage of our system creates an unlabeled parse y for an input sentence x . Only Arabic , Turkish and Slovene have parsing accuracies significantly below 80 % , and these languages have relatively small training sets and/or are highly inflected with little to no word order constraints . We have presented results showing that the spanning tree dependency parsing framework of McDonald et al . We have presented results showing that the spanning tree dependency parsing framework of McDonald et al . We evaluate this parser on a diverse set of 13 languages using data provided by the CoNLL-X shared-task organizers ( Buchholz et al. , 2006 ; Haji & # 711 ; c et al. , 2004 ; Simov et al. , 2005 ; Simov and Osenova , 2003 ; Chen et al. , 2003 ; B & # 168 ; ohmov & # 180 ; a et al. , 2003 ; Kromann , 2003 ; van der Beek et al. , 2002 ; Brants et al. , 2002 ; Kawata and Bartels , 2000 ; Afonso et al. , 2002 ; D & # 711 ; zeroski et al. , 2006 ; Civit Torruella and MartiAntonin , 2002 ; Nilsson et al. , 2005 ; Oflazer et al. , 2003 ;
