The data-drivenness of this approach presents a clear advantage over the traditional, idealised notion of competence grammar. The following commands are available: The three tagsets used by the annotation tool (for words, phrases, and edges) are variable and are stored together with the corpus. We will closely coordinate the further development of our corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation. Since the combinatorics of syntactic constructions creates a. demand for very large corpora., efficiency of annotation is an important. criterion for the success of the developed methodology and tools. Realworld texts annotated with different strata of linguistic information can be used for grammar induction. For the implementation, we used Tcl/Tk Version 4.1. In addition the approach provides empirical material for psycholinguistic investigation, since preferences for the choice of certain syntactic constructions, linea.rizations, and attachments that have been observed in online experiments of language production and comprehension can now be put in relation with the frequency of these alternatives in larger amounts of texts. Due to the frequency of discontinuous constituents in non-configurational languages, the filler-trace mechanism would be used very often, yielding syntactic trees fairly different from the underlying predicate-argument structures. The corpus is stored in a SQL database. Sentences annotated in previous steps are used as training material for further processing. Existing treebank annotation schemes exhibit a fairly uniform architecture, as they all have to meet the same basic requirements, namely: Descriptivity: Grammatical phenomena are to be described rather than explained.
