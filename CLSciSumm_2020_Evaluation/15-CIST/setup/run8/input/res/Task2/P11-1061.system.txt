8217 ; s monolingual unsupervised state-of-the-art model ( 73.0 % ) , and considerably bridges the gap to fully supervised POS tagging performance ( 96.6 % ) . We describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part-of-speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data , but have translated text in a resource-rich language . 8217 ; s monolingual unsupervised state-of-the-art model ( 73.0 % ) , and considerably bridges the gap to fully supervised POS tagging performance ( 96.6 % ) . The foreign language vertices ( denoted by Vf ) correspond to foreign trigram types , exactly as in Subramanya et al . ( 2011 ) . ( 2010 ) . They considered a semi-supervised POS tagging scenario and showed that one can use a graph over trigram types , and edge weights based on distributional similarity , to improve a supervised conditional random field tagger . Unsupervised learning approaches appear to be a natural solution to this problem , as they require only unannotated text for training models . We were intentionally lenient with our baselines : bilingual information by projecting POS tags directly across alignments in the parallel data . Second , we treat the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model ( & # 167 ; 5 ) , rather than using them directly for supervised training . Because we are interested in applying our techniques to languages for which no labeled resources are available , we paid particular attention to minimize the
