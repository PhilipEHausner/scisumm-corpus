Although Bod\ 's method obtains very competitive results on the Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) task , the parsing time was reported to be over 200 seconds per sentence ( Bod 2003 ) . In the following section first results of SL-DOP and LS-DOP with a compact PCFG-reduction . The derivation with the smallest sum , or highest rank , is taken as the final best derivation producing the best parse tree in Simplicity-DOP.3 Although Bod ( 2000b ) reports that Simplicity DOP is outperformed by Likelihood-DOP , its results are still rather impressive for such a simple model . Although Bod\ 's method obtains very competitive results on the Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) task , the parsing time was reported to be over 200 seconds per sentence ( Bod 2003 ) . In Bod ( 2000b ) , an alternative notion for the best parse tree was proposed based on a simplicity criterion : instead of producing the most probable tree , this model produced the tree generated by the shortest derivation with the fewest training subtrees . Although Bod\ 's method obtains very competitive results on the Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) task , the parsing time was reported to be over 200 seconds per sentence ( Bod 2003 ) . Bod ( 2001 , 2003 ) . Yet , his grammar contains more than 5 million subtrees and processing times of over 200 seconds per WSJ sentence are reported ( Bod 2003 )
