, simple addition ( equation ( 5 ) , Add ) , weighted addition ( equation ( 7 ) , WeightAdd ) , and Kintsch & For example , assuming that individual words are represented by vectors , we can compute the meaning of a sentence by taking their mean ( Foltz et al. , 1998 ; Landauer and Dumais , 1997 ) . Let K stand for any additional knowledge or information which is needed to construct the semantics of their composition . So , if we assume that only the ith components of u and v contribute to the ith component of p , that these components are not dependent on i , and that the function is symmetric with regard to the interchange of u and v , we obtain a simpler instantiation of an additive model : Analogously , under the same assumptions , we obtain the following simpler multiplicative model : only the ith components of u and v contribute to the ith component of p. To derive specific models from this general framework requires the identification of appropriate constraints to narrow the space of functions being considered . We expect better models to yield a pattern of similarity scores like those observed in the human ratings ( see Figure 2 ) . Let K stand for any additional knowledge or information which is needed to construct the semantics of their composition . So , if we assume that only the ith components of u
