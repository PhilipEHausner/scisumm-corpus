Our monolingual similarity function ( for connecting pairs of foreign trigram types ) is the same as the one used by Subramanya et al . Unfortunately , the best completely unsupervised English POS tagger ( that does not make use of a tagging dictionary ) reaches only 76.1 % accuracy ( Christodoulopoulos et al. , 2010 ) , making its practical usability questionable at best . For each language under consideration , Petrov et al . While there might be some controversy about the exact definition of such a tagset , these 12 categories cover the most frequent part-of-speech and exist in one form or another in all of the languages that we studied . Unfortunately , the best completely unsupervised English POS tagger ( that does not make use of a tagging dictionary ) reaches only 76.1 % accuracy ( Christodoulopoulos et al. , 2010 ) , making its practical usability questionable at best . Second , we treat the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model ( & # 167 ; 5 ) , rather than using them directly for supervised training . 65533 ; f. 8722
