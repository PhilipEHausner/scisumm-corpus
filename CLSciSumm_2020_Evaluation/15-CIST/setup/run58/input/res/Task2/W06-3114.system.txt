The evaluation framework for the shared task is similar to the one used in last year&#8217;s shared task. Hence, we use the bootstrap resampling method described by Koehn (2004). We are therefore applying a different method, which has been used at the 2005 DARPA/NIST evaluation. While the Bootstrap method is slightly more sensitive, it is very much in line with the sign test on text blocks. English was again paired with German, French, and Spanish. To summarize, we provided: The performance of the baseline system is similar to the best submissions in last year&#8217;s shared task. Most of these groups follow a phrase-based statistical approach to machine translation. About half of the participants of last year&#8217;s shared task participated again.
