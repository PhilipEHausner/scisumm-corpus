In considering the relationship between formalisms, we show that it is useful to abstract away from the details of the formalism, and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees. find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by Context-Free Grammars On the basis of this observation, we describe a class of formalisms which we call Linear Context- Free Rewriting Systems, and show they are recognizable in polynomial time and generate only semilinear languages. Little attention, however, has been paid to the structural descriptions that these formalisms can assign to strings, i.e. their strong generative capacity. For example, Gazdar (1985) discusses the applicability of Indexed Grammars (IG\'s) to Natural Language in terms of the structural descriptions assigned; and Berwick (1984) discusses the strong generative capacity of Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) and Government and Bindings grammars (GB). In the remainder of the paper, we outline how a class of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS\'s) may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows. TAG\'s can be used to give the structural descriptions discussed by Gazdar (1985) for the unbounded nested dependencies in Norwedish, for cross serial dependencies in Dutch subordinate clauses, and for the nestings of paired English complementizers. 0n0\'i\'i0\'2&amp;quot;bin242bn I n = 711 + n2 } On the other hand, no linguistic use is made of this general form of composition and
