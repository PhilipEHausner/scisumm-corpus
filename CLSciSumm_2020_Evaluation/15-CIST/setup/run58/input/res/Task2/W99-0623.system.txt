Three state-of-the-art statistical parsers are combined to produce more accurate parses, as well as new bounds on achievable Treebank parsing accuracy. We then show that the combining techniques presented above give better parsing accuracy than any of the individual parsers. Combining multiple highly-accurate independent parsers yields promising results. We would like to thank Eugene Charniak, Michael Collins, and Adwait Ratnaparkhi for enabling all of this research by providing us with their parsers and helpful comments. Recently, combination techniques have been investigated for part of speech tagging with positive results (van Halteren et al., 1998; Brill and Wu, 1998). Under certain conditions the constituent voting and na&#239;ve Bayes constituent combination techniques are guaranteed to produce sets of constituents with no crossing brackets. Similarly Figures 1 and 2 show how the isolated constituent precision varies by sentence length and the size of the span of the hypothesized constituent. The precision and recall of similarity switching and constituent voting are both significantly better than the best individual parser, and constituent voting is significantly better than parser switching in precision.4 Constituent voting gives the highest accuracy for parsing the Penn Treebank reported to date. These three parsers have given the best reported parsing results on the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus (Marcus et al., 1993). We used these three parsers to explore parser combination techniques. The precision and recall measures (described in more detail in Section 3) used in evaluating Treebank parsing treat each constituent as a separate entity, a minimal unit of
