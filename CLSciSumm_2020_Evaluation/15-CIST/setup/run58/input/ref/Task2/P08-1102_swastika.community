We trained a character-based perceptron for Chinese Joint S&amp;T, and found that the perceptron itself could achieve considerably high accuracy on segmentation and Joint S&amp;T. Templates immediately borrowed from Ng and Low (2004) are listed in the upper column named non-lexical-target. The second was conducted on the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.0 (CTB5.0) to test the performance of the cascaded model on segmentation and Joint S&amp;T. All feature templates and their instances are shown in Table 1. Figure 3 shows their learning curves depicting the F-measure on the development set after 1 to 10 training iterations.</S The first was conducted to test the performance of the perceptron on segmentation on the corpus from SIGHAN Bakeoff 2, including the Academia Sinica Corpus (AS), the Hong Kong City University Corpus (CityU), the Peking University Corpus (PKU) and the Microsoft Research Corpus (MSR). Shown in Figure 1, the cascaded model has a two-layer architecture, with a characterbased perceptron as the core combined with other real-valued features such as language models. The feature templates we adopted are selected from those of Ng and Low (2004).</
