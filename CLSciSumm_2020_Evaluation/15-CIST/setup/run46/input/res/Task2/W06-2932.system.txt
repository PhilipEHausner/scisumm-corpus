The first stage based on the unlabeled dependency parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006) augmented with morphological features for a subset of the languages. This system is primarily based on the parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006). That work extends the maximum spanning tree dependency parsing framework (McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald et al., 2005b) to incorporate features over multiple edges in the dependency graph. We have presented results showing that the spanning tree dependency parsing framework of McDonald et al. (McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) generalizes well to languages other than English. This has been shown through their successful use in many standard natural language processing tasks, including machine translation (Ding and Palmer, 2005), sentence compression (McDonald, 2006), and textual inference (Haghighi et al., 2005). However, in a two stage system we can incorporate features over the entire output of the unlabeled parser since that structure is fixed as input. Furthermore, it made the system homogeneous in terms of learning algorithms since that is what is used to train our unlabeled parser (McDonald and Pereira, 2006). These results show that the discriminative spanning tree parsing framework (McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) is easily adapted across all these languages. In fact, for every language our models perform significantly higher than the average performance for all the systems reported in Buchholz et al. (2006). We report results on the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz et al., 2006) data sets and present an
