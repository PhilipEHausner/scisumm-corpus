We describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages. The following commands are available: The three tagsets used by the annotation tool (for words, phrases, and edges) are variable and are stored together with the corpus. We will closely coordinate the further development of our corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation. Since the combinatorics of syntactic constructions creates a. demand for very large corpora., efficiency of annotation is an important. criterion for the success of the developed methodology and tools. Realworld texts annotated with different strata of linguistic information can be used for grammar induction. Corpora annotated with syntactic structures are commonly referred to as trctbank.5. In order to avoid inconsistencies, the corpus is annotated in two stages: basic annotation and nfirtellte714. For the implementation, we used Tcl/Tk Version 4.1. Due to the frequency of discontinuous constituents in non-configurational languages, the filler-trace mechanism would be used very often, yielding syntactic trees fairly different from the underlying predicate-argument structures. Sentences annotated in previous steps are used as training material for further processing. This amount of data suffices as training material to reliably assign the grammatical functions if the user determines the elements of a phrase and its type (step 1 of the list above). A formalism complying with these requirements is described in section 3. Existing treebank annotation schemes exhibit a fairly uniform architecture, as they all have to meet the same basic requirements,
