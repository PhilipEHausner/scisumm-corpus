The first sense heuristic which is often used as a baseline for supervised WSD systems outperforms many of these systems which take surrounding context into account. Even systems which show superior performance to this heuristic often make use of the heuristic where evidence from the context is not sufficient (Hoste et al., 2001). We believe that an automatic means of finding a predominant sense would be useful for systems that use it as a means of backing-off (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998; Hoste et al., 2001) and for systems that use it in lexical acquisition (McCarthy, 1997; Merlo and Leybold, 2001; Korhonen, 2002) because of the limited size of hand-tagged resources. To disambiguate senses a system should take context into account. Whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense-tagged corpus such as SemCor is clearly useful, there is a strong case for obtaining a first, or predominant, sense from untagged corpus data so that a WSD system can be tuned to the genre or domain at hand. More importantly, when working within a specific domain one would wish to tune the first sense heuristic to the domain at hand. We are currently investigating the performance of the first sense heuristic, and this method, for other PoS on SENSEVAL-3 data (McCarthy et al., 2004), although not yet with rankings from domain specific corpora. We discuss our method in the following section. Sections 3 and 4 concern experiments using predominant senses from the BNC evaluated against the data in SemCor and the
