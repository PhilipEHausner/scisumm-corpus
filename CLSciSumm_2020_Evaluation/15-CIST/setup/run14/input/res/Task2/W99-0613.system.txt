But we will show that the use of unlabeled data can drastically reduce the need for supervision . This paper discusses the use of unlabeled examples for the problem of named entity classification . Unsupervised Models for Named Entity Classification Collin . In principle a feature could be an arbitrary predicate of the ( spelling , context ) pair ; for reasons that will become clear , features are limited to querying either the spelling or context alone . This paper discusses the use of unlabeled examples for the problem of named entity classification . Future work should also extend the approach to build a complete named entity extractor - a method that pulls proper names from text and then classifies them . In this work we extended the AdaBoost.MH ( Schapire and Singer 98 ) algorithm to the cotraining case . ( We would like to note though that unlike previous boosting algorithms , the CoBoost algorithm presented here is not a boosting algorithm under Valiant\ 's ( Valiant 84 ) Probably Approximately Correct ( PAC ) model.. The DL-CoTrain algorithm can be motivated as being a greedy method of satisfying the above 2 constraints . Unfortunately , Yarowsky\ 's method is not well understood from a theoretical viewpoint : we would like to formalize the notion of redundancy in unlabeled data , and set up the learning task as optimization of some appropriate objective function .
