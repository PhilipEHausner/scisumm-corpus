We outlined the definition of a family of constrained grammatical formalisms , called Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems . find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by Context-Free Grammars On the basis of this observation , we describe a class of formalisms which we call Linear Context- Free Rewriting Systems , and show they are recognizable in polynomial time and generate only semilinear languages . As is described in Section 4 , the property of having a derivation tree set that is a local set appears to be useful in showing important properties of the languages generated by the formalisms .
