8211 ; 25 % , the total proportion of non-projective arcs is normally only 1 & When the parser is trained on the transformed data , it will ideally learn not only to construct projective dependency structures but also to assign arc labels that encode information about lifts . 168 ; arvinen ( 1997 ) and Wang and Harper ( 2004 ) for English , Foth et al . In section 2 we introduce the graph transformation techniques used to projectivize and deprojectivize dependency graphs , and in section 3 we describe the data-driven dependency parser that is the core of our system . Using this encoding scheme , the arc from je to Z in Figure 2 would be assigned the label AuxP & Thus , most broad-coverage parsers based on dependency grammar have been restricted to projective structures . We have presented a new method for non-projective dependency parsing , based on a combination of data-driven projective dependency parsing and graph transformation techniques . Using this encoding scheme , the arc from je to Z in Figure 2 would be assigned the label AuxP & Using this encoding scheme , the arc from je to Z in Figure 2 would be assigned the label AuxP & Before we turn to the evaluation , however , we need to introduce the data-driven dependency parser used in the latter experiments . 8212 ; * & 8211 ; 25 % , the total proportion of non-projective arcs is normally only 1
