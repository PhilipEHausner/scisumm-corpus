This may be explained by the fact our best results in Bod ( 2001 ) were obtained by testing various subtree restrictions until the highest accuracy was obtained , while in the current experiment we used all subtrees as given by the PCFG-reduction . It should be mentioned that the best precision and recall scores reported in Bod ( 2001 ) are slightly better than the ones reported here ( the difference is only 0.2 % for sentences 100 words ) . Yet , his grammar contains more than 5 million subtrees and processing times of over 200 seconds per WSJ sentence are reported ( Bod 2003 ) . Note that Goodman\ 's reduction method does still not allow for an efficient computation of the most probable parse tree of a sentence : there may still be exponentially many derivations generating the same tree . The distinctive feature of the DOP approach when it was proposed in 1992 was to model sentence structures on the basis of previously observed frequencies of sentence structure fragments , without imposing any constraints on the size of these fragments . Although Bod\ 's method obtains very competitive results on the Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) task , the parsing time was reported to be over 200 seconds per sentence ( Bod 2003 ) . \ 's estimator performs worse and is comparable to Collins ( 1996 ) . But while Bod\ 's estimator obtains state-of-the-art results on the WSJ , comparable to Charniak
