The derivation with the smallest sum, or highest rank, is taken as the final best derivation producing the best parse tree in Simplicity-DOP.3 Although Bod (2000b) reports that Simplicity DOP is outperformed by Likelihood-DOP, its results are still rather impressive for such a simple model. This paper showed that a PCFG-reduction of DOP in combination with a new notion of the best parse tree results in fast processing times and very competitive accuracy on the Wall Street Journal treebank. DOP1 has a serious bias: its subtree estimator provides more probability to nodes with more subtrees (Bonnema et al. 1999). While SL-DOP and LS-DOP have been compared before in Bod (2002), especially in the context of musical parsing, this paper presents the The DOP approach is based on two distinctive features: (1) the use of corpus fragments rather than grammar rules, and (2) the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones. The highest accuracy is obtained by SL-DOP at 12 n 14: an LP of 90.8% and an LR of 90.7%. The highest accuracy is obtained by SL-DOP at 12 n 14: an LP of 90.8% and an LR of 90.7%. In case the shortest derivation is not unique, Bod (2000b) proposes to back off to a frequency ordering of the subtrees. That is, all subtrees of each root label are assigned a rank according to their frequency in the treebank: the most frequent subtree (or subtrees) of each root label gets rank 1, the second most frequent subtree gets rank 2, etc. NA Most previous notions of best parse tree in DOP1 were based on a probabilistic metric, with Bod (2000b) as a notable exception, who used a simplicity metric based on the shortest derivation. For example, Bod (2001) samples a fixed number of subtrees of each depth, which has the effect of assigning roughly equal weight to each node in the training data, and roughly exponentially less probability for larger trees (see Goodman 2002: 12). Bod reports state-of-the-art results with this method, and observes no decrease in parse accuracy when larger subtrees are included (using subtrees up to depth 14). The only thing that needs to be changed for Simplicity-DOP is that all subtrees should be assigned equal probabilities.
