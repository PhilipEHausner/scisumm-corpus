Our integrated model represents syntax and semantics jointly using augmented parse trees . We have demonstrated , at least for one problem , that a lexicalized , probabilistic context-free parser with head rules ( LPCFGHR ) can be used effectively for information extraction . In our statistical model , trees are generated according to a process similar to that described in ( Collins 1996 , 1997 ) . The semantic training corpus was produced by students according to a simple set of guidelines . The semantic training corpus was produced by students according to a simple set of guidelines . There is no opportunity for a later stage , such as parsing , to influence or correct an earlier stage such as part-of-speech tagging . In our statistical model , trees are generated according to a process similar to that described in ( Collins 1996 , 1997 ) . In these trees , the standard TREEBANK structures are augmented to convey semantic information , that is , entities and relations . Chiba , ( 1999 ) was able to use such a parsing algorithm to reduce perplexity with the long term goal of improved speech recognition . We evaluated the new approach to information extraction on two of the tasks of the Seventh Message Understanding Conference ( MUC-7 ) and reported in ( Marsh , 1998 ) .
