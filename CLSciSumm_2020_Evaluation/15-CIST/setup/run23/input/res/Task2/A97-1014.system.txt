The development of linguistically interpreted corpora presents a laborious and time-consuming task . Their further classification must reflect different kinds of linguistic information : morphology ( e.g. , case , inflection ) , category , dependency type ( complementation vs. modification ) , thematic role , etc.\ . Since the combinatorics of syntactic constructions creates a. treebank for :30,000 German spoken sentences as well as for the same amount of English and Japanese sentences will be created . A uniform representation of local and non-local dependencies makes the structure more transparent\ ' . Since the combinatorics of syntactic constructions creates a. Due to the frequency of discontinuous constituents in non-configurational languages , the filler-trace mechanism would be used very often , yielding syntactic trees fairly different from the underlying predicate-argument structures . Corpora annotated with syntactic structures are commonly referred to as trctbank.5 . treebank for :30,000 German spoken sentences as well as for the same amount of English and Japanese sentences will be created . , efficiency of annotation is an important . This requirement speaks against the traditional sort of dependency trees , in which heads a , re represented as non-terminal nodes , cf . Argument structure can be represented in terms of unordered trees ( with crossing branches ) . PM stands for morphological particle , a label for German infinitival Z7t and superlative am . Argument structure can be represented in terms of unordered trees ( with crossing branches ) .
