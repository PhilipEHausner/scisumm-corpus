In considering the relationship between formalisms , we show that it is useful to abstract away from the details of the formalism , and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees . Thus , as in CFG\ 's , at any point in the derivation , the set of structures that can be applied is determined only by a finite set of rules encapsulated by the grammar . Little attention , however , has been paid to the structural descriptions that these formalisms can assign to strings , i.e .

In considering the relationship between formalisms , we show that it is useful to abstract away from the details of the formalism , and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees . As is described in Section 4 , the property of having a derivation tree set that is a local set appears to be useful in showing important properties of the languages generated by the formalisms . Much of the study of grammatical systems in computational linguistics has been focused on the weak generative capacity of grammatical formalism .
