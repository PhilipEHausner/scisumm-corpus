In Chinese Joint S & amp ; T , the mission of the decoder is to find the boundary-POS labelled sequence with the highest score . Templates in the column below are expanded from the upper ones . Shown in Figure 1 , the cascaded model has a two-layer architecture , with a characterbased perceptron as the core combined with other real-valued features such as language models . On the three corpora , it also outperformed the word-based perceptron model of Zhang and Clark ( 2007 ) . We add a field C0 to each template in the upper column , so that it can carry out predication according to not only the context but also the current character itself . In Chinese Joint S & amp ; T , the mission of the decoder is to find the boundary-POS labelled sequence with the highest score . Test results listed in Table 2 shows that this model obtains higher accuracy than the best of SIGHAN Bakeoff 2 in three corpora ( AS , CityU and MSR ) . However , can the perceptron incorporate all the knowledge used in the outside-layer linear model . In theory , any useful knowledge can be incorporated into the perceptron directly , besides the characterbased features already adopted . Given a Chinese character sequence C1 : n , the decoding procedure can proceed in a left-right fashion with a dynamic programming approach . Additional features most widely used are related to word or POS
