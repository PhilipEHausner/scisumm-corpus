Further details are discussed in the section Tree Augmentation. In this section, we describe the algorithm that was used to automatically produce augmented trees, starting with a) human-generated semantic annotations and b) machinegenerated syntactic parse trees. Word features are introduced primarily to help with unknown words, as in (Weischedel et al. 1993). We illustrate the generation process by walking through a few of the steps of the parse shown in Figure 3. To produce a corpus of augmented parse trees, we used the following multi-step training procedure which exploited the Penn TREEBANK Applying this procedure yielded a new version of the semantically annotated corpus, now annotated with complete augmented trees like that in Figure 3. In our statistical model, trees are generated according to a process similar to that described in (Collins 1996, 1997). Maximum likelihood estimates for the model probabilities can be obtained by observing frequencies in the training corpus. For modifier constituents, the mixture components are: For part-of-speech tags, the mixture components are: Finally, for word features, the mixture components are. We evaluated the new approach to information extraction on two of the tasks of the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7) and reported in (Marsh, 1998). Figure 4 shows an example of the semantic annotation, which was the only type of manual annotation we performed. The semantic training corpus was produced by students according to a simple set of guidelines. This simple semantic annotation was the only source of task knowledge used to configure the model. If the
