We will closely coordinate the further development of our corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation . The work reported in this paper aims at providing syntactically annotated corpora ( treebanks\ ' ) for stochastic grammar induction . The work reported in this paper aims at providing syntactically annotated corpora ( treebanks\ ' ) for stochastic grammar induction . We describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages . Sentences annotated in previous steps are used as training material for further processing . demand for very large corpora. The typical treebank architecture is as follows : Structures : A context-free backbone is augmented with trace-filler representations of non-local dependencies . During annotation , the highest rated grammatical function labels Gi are calculated using the Viterbi algorithm and assigned to the structure , i.e. This amount of data suffices as training material to reliably assign the grammatical functions if the user determines the elements of a phrase and its type ( step 1 of the list above ) . This requirement speaks against the traditional sort of dependency trees , in which heads a , re represented as non-terminal nodes , cf .
