This is illustrated in the example below taken from Landauer et al . In cognitive science vector-based models have been successful in simulating semantic priming ( Lund and Burgess , 1996 ; Landauer and Dumais , 1997 ) and text comprehension ( Landauer and Dumais , 1997 ; Foltz et al. , 1998 ) . Finally , Kintsch & Under this framework , we introduce a wide range of composition models which we evaluate empirically on a sentence similarity task . Finally , Kintsch & Model Parameters Irrespectively of their form , all composition models discussed here are based on a semantic space for representing the meanings of individual words . This is illustrated in the example below taken from Landauer et al . Specifically , we present both additive and multiplicative models of vector combination and assess their performance on a sentence similarity rating experiment . Central in these models is the notion of compositionality & Central in these models is the notion of compositionality & Conversely , when color is combined with ran , the resulting vector will be closer to dissolve than gallop . 8217 ; s ( 2001 ) model ( equation ( 10 ) , Kintsch ) , a multiplicative model ( equation ( 6 ) , Multiply ) , and also a model which combines multiplication with addition ( equation ( 11 ) , Combined ) . Conversely , when color is combined with ran , the resulting vector will be closer to dissolve
