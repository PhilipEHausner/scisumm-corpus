Combining raw language data with linguistic information offers a promising basis for the development of new efficient and robust NLP methods . Due to the frequency of discontinuous constituents in non-configurational languages , the filler-trace mechanism would be used very often , yielding syntactic trees fairly different from the underlying predicate-argument structures . In order to avoid inconsistencies , the corpus is annotated in two stages : basic annotation and nfirtellte714 . A tree meeting these requirements is given below : Adv V NP NP V CPL NP V damn wird ihn Anna erkennen , dais er \'vein . For the implementation , we used Tcl/Tk Version 4.1 . Existing treebank annotation schemes exhibit a fairly uniform architecture , as they all have to meet the same basic requirements , namely : Descriptivity : Grammatical phenomena are to be described rather than explained . For the implementation , we used Tcl/Tk Version 4.1 . As the annotation scheme described in this paper focusses on annotating argument structure rather than constituent trees , it differs from existing treebanks in several aspects . In order to avoid inconsistencies , the corpus is annotated in two stages : basic annotation and nfirtellte714 . Existing treebank annotation schemes exhibit a fairly uniform architecture , as they all have to meet the same basic requirements , namely : Descriptivity : Grammatical phenomena are to be described rather than explained .
