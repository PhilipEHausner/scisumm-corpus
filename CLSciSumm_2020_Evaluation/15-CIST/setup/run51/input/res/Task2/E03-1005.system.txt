Many implementations of DOP1 therefore estimate the most probable parse by Monte Carlo techniques ( Bod 1998 ; Chappelier & amp ; Rajman 2000 ) , or by Viterbi n-best search ( Bod 2001 ) , or by restricting the set of subtrees ( Sima\'an 1999 ; Chappelier et al . 2002 ) . Together with a PCFGreduction of DOP we obtain improved accuracy and efficiency on the Wall Street Journal treebank Our results show an 11 % relative reduction in error rate over previous models , and an average processing time of 3.6 seconds per WSJ sentence . This approach has now gained wide usage , as exemplified by the work of Collins ( 1996 , 1999 ) , Charniak ( 1996 , 1997 ) , Johnson ( 1998 ) , Chiang ( 2000 ) , and many others .

Although Bod\ 's method obtains very competitive results on the Wall Street Journal
