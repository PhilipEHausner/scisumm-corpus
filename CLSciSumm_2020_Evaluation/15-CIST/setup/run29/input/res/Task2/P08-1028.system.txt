, simple addition ( equation ( 5 ) , Add ) , weighted addition ( equation ( 7 ) , WeightAdd ) , and Kintsch & , simple addition ( equation ( 5 ) , Add ) , weighted addition ( equation ( 7 ) , WeightAdd ) , and Kintsch & The weighted additive model ( p = 0.09 ) is not significantly different from the baseline either or Kintsch ( 2001 ) ( p = 0.09 ) . Central in these models is the notion of compositionality & In this paper we presented a general framework for vector-based semantic composition . In this paper we presented a general framework for vector-based semantic composition . Despite the popularity of additive models , our experimental results showed the superiority of models utilizing multiplicative combinations , at least for the sentence similarity task attempted here . Central in these models is the notion of compositionality & The weighted additive model ( p = 0.09 ) is not significantly different from the baseline either or Kintsch ( 2001 ) ( p = 0.09 ) . Following previous work ( Bullinaria and Levy , 2007 ) , we optimized its parameters on a word-based semantic similarity task . We used Spearman & Further constraints can be introduced to reduce the free parameters in these models . A variety of NLP tasks have made good use of vector-based models . Further constraints can be introduced to reduce the free parameters in these models .
