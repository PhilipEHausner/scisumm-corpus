Cohen and Smith ( 2007 ) later on based a system for joint inference on factored , independent , morphological and syntactic components of which scores are combined to cater for the joint inference task . 8217 ; an ( 2007 ) have reported state-of-the-art results on Hebrew unlexicalized parsing ( 74.41 % ) albeit assuming oracle morphological segmentation . Here we push the single-framework conjecture across the board and present a single model that performs morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation in a fully generative framework . wn and a morphological analyzer , we look for the most probable parse tree & 8217 ; an et al .

A Single Generative Model for Joint Morphological Segmentation and Syntactic Parsin . A morphological analyzer M : W & ( we ignored the 419 trees in their development set.. ( Levinger et al. , 1995 ; Goldberg et al. , ; Adler et al. , 2008 ) ) will make the parser more robust and suitable for use in more realistic scenarios . Such resources exist for Hebrew ( Itai et al. , 2006 ) , but unfortunately use a tagging scheme
