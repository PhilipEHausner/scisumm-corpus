The current work treats both segmental and super-segmental phenomena , yet we note that there may be more adequate ways to treat supersegmental phenomena assuming Word-Based morphology as we explore in ( Tsarfaty and Goldberg , 2008 ) . Cohen and Smith ( 2007 ) later on based a system for joint inference on factored , independent , morphological and syntactic components of which scores are combined to cater for the joint inference task . The Grammar Our parser looks for the most likely tree spanning a single path through the lattice of which the yield is a sequence of lexemes . We first make use of our morphological analyzer to find all segmentation possibilities by chopping off all prefix sequence possibilities ( including the empty prefix ) and construct a lattice off of them . We claim that no particular morphological segmentation is a-priory more likely for surface forms before exploring the compositional nature of syntactic structures , including manifestations of various long-distance dependencies . ( we ignored the 419 trees in their development set.. Morphological Analyzer Ideally , we
