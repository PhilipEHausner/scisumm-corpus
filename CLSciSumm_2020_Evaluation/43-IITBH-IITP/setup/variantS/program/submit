These packages are further described in Section 3.
In addition to the optimizations specific to each datastructure described in Section 2  we implement several general optimizations for language modeling.
This paper describes the several performance techniques used and presents benchmarks against alternative implementations.
Finally  other packages implement language model estimation while we are currently dependent on them to generate an ARPA file.
Section 4.1 explained that state s is stored by applications with partial hypotheses to determine when they can be recombined.
