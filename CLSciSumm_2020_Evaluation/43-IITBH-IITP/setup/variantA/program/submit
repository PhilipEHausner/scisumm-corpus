For sorted lookup  we compare interpolation search  standard C++ binary search  and standard C++ set based on red-black trees.
Throughout this paper we compare with several packages: SRILM 1.5.12 (Stolcke  2002) is a popular toolkit based on tries used in several decoders.
For example  syntactic decoders (Koehn et al.  2007; Dyer et al.  2010; Li et al.  2009) perform dynamic programming parametrized by both backward- and forward-looking state.
We evaluate the time and memory consumption of each data structure by computing perplexity on 4 billion tokens from the English Gigaword corpus (Parker et al.  2009).
Along with IRSTLM and TPT  our binary format is memory mapped  meaning the file and in-memory representation are the same.
