the problem with using the predominant or first sense heuristic aside from the fact that it does not take surrounding context into account is that it assumes some quantity of handtagged data 
we see that both domains have a similarly high percentage of factotum domain independent labels but as we would expect the other peaks correspond to the economy label for the finance corpus and the sports label for the sports corpus inant senses for polysemous words ranked using the sports and finance corpus 
if is the set of co occurrence types such that is positive then the similarity between two nouns and can be computed as where a thesaurus entry of size for a target noun is then defined as the most similar nouns to 
lapata and brew obtain their priors for verb classes directly from subcategorisation evidence in a parsed corpus whereas we use parsed data to find distributionally similar words nearest neighbours to the target word which reflect the different senses of the word and have associated distributional similarity scores which can be used for ranking the senses according to prevalence 
we then use the wordnet similarity package patwardhan and pedersen to give us a semantic similarity measure hereafter referred to as the wordnet similarity measure to weight the contribution that each neighbour makes to the various senses of the target word 
the first sense heuristic which is often used as a baseline for supervised wsd systems outperforms many of these systems which take surrounding context into account
