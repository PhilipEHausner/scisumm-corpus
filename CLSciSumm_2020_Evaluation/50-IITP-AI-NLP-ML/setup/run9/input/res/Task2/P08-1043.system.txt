to evaluate the performance on the segmentation task we report seg the standard harmonic means for segmentation precision and recall f as defined in bar haim et al tsarfaty as well as the segmentation accuracy segtok measure indicating the percentage of input tokens assigned the correct exact segmentation as reported by cohen and smith 
a less canonical representation of segmental morphology is triggered by a morpho phonological process of omitting the definite article h when occurring after the particles b or l this process triggers ambiguity as for the definiteness status of nouns following these particles we refer to such cases in which the concatenation of elements does not strictly correspond to the original surface form as super segmental morphology 
morphological segmentation decisions in our model are delegated to a lexeme based pcfg and we show that using a simple treebank grammar a data driven lexicon and a linguistically motivated unknown tokens handling our model outperforms tsarfaty and cohen and smith on the joint task and achieves state of the art results on a par with current respective standalone models 
our use of an unweighted lattice reflects our belief that all the segmentations of the given input sentence are a priori equally likely the only reason to prefer one segmentation over the another is due to the overall syntactic context which is modeled via the pcfg derivations 
this token may further embed into a larger utterance e g bcl hneim literally in the shadow the pleasant meaning roughly in the pleasant shadow in which the dominated noun is modified by a proceeding space delimited adjective
