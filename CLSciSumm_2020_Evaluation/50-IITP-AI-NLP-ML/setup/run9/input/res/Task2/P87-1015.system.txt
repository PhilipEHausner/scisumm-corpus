in considering the relationship between formalisms we show that it is useful to abstract away from the details of the formalism and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by context free grammars on the basis of this observation we describe a class of formalisms which we call linear context free rewriting systems and show they are recognizable in polynomial time and generate only semilinear languages 
for example gazdar discusses the applicability of indexed grammars ig s to natural language in terms of the structural descriptions assigned and berwick discusses the strong generative capacity of lexical functional grammar lfg and government and bindings grammars gb 
for example in tag s a derived auxiliary tree spans two substrings to the left and right of the foot node and the adjunction operation inserts another substring spanned by the subtree under the node where adjunction takes place between them see figure 
thus the tree sets generated by hg s are similar to those of cfg s with each node annotated by the operation concatenation or wrapping used to combine the headed strings derived by the daughters of tree adjoining grammars a tree rewriting formalism was introduced by joshi levy and takahashi and joshi 
in the remainder of the paper we outline how a class of linear context free rewriting systems lcfrs s may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows
