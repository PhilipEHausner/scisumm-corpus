the following features of our formalism are then of particular importance the current tagset comprises only node labels and function tags yet a finely grinned classification will take place in the near future 
as the annotation scheme described in this paper focusses on annotating argument structure rather than constituent trees it differs from existing treebanks in several aspects 
since a precise structural description of non constituent coordination would require a rich inventory of incomplete phrase types we have agreed on a sort of unde rspe cified representations the coordinated units are assigned structures in which missing lexical material is not represented at the level of primary links 
 shows the representation of the sentence sic wurde von preubischen truppen besetzt she was by prussian troops occupied und dem preuliischen staat angegliedert and to the prussian state incorporated it was occupied by prussian troops and incorporated into prussia in the category of the coordination is labeled cvp here where c stands for coordination and vp for the actual category 
consider the german sentence daran wird ihn anna erkennen di er weint at it will him anna recognise that he cries anna will recognise him at his cry a sample constituent structure is given below the fairly short sentence contains three non local dependencies marked by co references between traces and the corresponding nodes 
as modern linguistics is also becoming more aware of the importance of larger sets of naturally occurring data interpreted corpora are a valuable resource for theoretical and descriptive linguistic research
