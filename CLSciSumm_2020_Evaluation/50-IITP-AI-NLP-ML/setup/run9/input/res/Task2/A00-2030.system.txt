the categories for head constituents cl are predicted based solely on the category of the parent node cp modifier constituent categories cm are predicted based on their parent node cp the head constituent of their parent node chp the previously generated modifier c and the head word of their parent wp 
given multiple constituents that cover identical spans in the chart only those constituents with probabilities within a while our focus throughout the project was on te and tr we became curious about how well the model did at part of speech tagging syntactic parsing and at name finding 
currently the prevailing architecture for dividing sentential processing is a four stage pipeline consisting of since we were interested in exploiting recent advances in parsing replacing the syntactic analysis stage of the standard pipeline with a modern statistical parser was an obvious possibility 
because generative statistical models had already proven successful for each of the first three stages we were optimistic that some of their properties especially their ability to learn from large amounts of data and their robustness when presented with unexpected inputs would also benefit semantic analysis 
for the following example the the template relations tr task involves identifying instances of three relations in the text tr builds on te in that tr reports binary relations between elements of te 
in this paper we report adapting a lexic al ized probabilistic context free parser to information extraction and evaluate this new technique on muc template elements and template relations
