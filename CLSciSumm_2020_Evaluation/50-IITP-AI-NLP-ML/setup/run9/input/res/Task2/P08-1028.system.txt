so if we assume that only the ith components of u and v contribute to the ith component of p that these components are not dependent on i and that the function is symmetric with regard to the interchange of u and v we obtain a simpler instantiation of an additive model analogously under the same assumptions we obtain the following simpler multiplicative model only the ith components of u and v contribute to the ith component of p another class of models can be derived by relaxing this constraint 
analysis of similarity ratings the reliability of the collected judgments is important for our evaluation experiments we therefore performed several tests to validate the quality of the ratings 
to give a concrete example circular convolution is an instance of the general multiplicative model which breaks this constraint by allowing uj to contribute to pi for example according to the addition of the two vectors representing horse and run in figure would yield horse run 
now if we assume that p lies in the same space as u and v avoiding the issues of dimensionality associated with tensor products and that f is a linear function for simplicity of the cartesian product of u and v then we generate a class of additive models where a and b are matrices which determine the contributions made by u and v to the product p in contrast if we assume that f is a linear function of the tensor product of u and v then we obtain multiplicative models where c is a tensor of rank which projects the tensor product of u and v onto the space of p further constraints can be introduced to reduce the free parameters in these models
