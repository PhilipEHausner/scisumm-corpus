topic models have been used for analyzing topic trends in research literature mann et al hall et al inferring captions for images blei and jordan social network analysis in email mccallum et al and expanding queries with topically related words in information retrieval wei and croft 
this topic provides an illustration of the variation in technical terminology captured by pltm including the wide array of acronyms used by different languages 
anew document tuple w w wl is generated by first drawing a tuple specific topic distribution from an asymmetric dirichlet prior with concentration parameter and base measure m then for each language l a latent topic assignment is drawn for each token in that language finally the observed tokens are themselves drawn using the language specific topic parameters wl p wl zl l n lwl zl 
although we find that if wikipedia contains an article on a particular subject in some language the article will tend to be topically similar to the articles about that subject in other languages we also find that across the whole collection different languages emphasize topics to different extents 
additionally pltm can support the creation of bilingual lexica for low resource language pairs providing candidate translations for more computationally intense alignment processes without the sentence aligned translations typically used in such tasks 
we evaluate sets of high probability words in each topic and multilingual synsets by comparing them to entries in human constructed bilingual dictionaries as done by haghighi et al 
previous work on bilingual topic modeling has focused on machine translation applications which rely on sentence aligned parallel translations
