this is a standard adaptation problem for smt 
linear weights are difficult to incorporate into the standard mert procedure because they are hidden within a top level probability that represents the linear combination following previous work foster and kuhn we circumvent this problem by choosing weights to optimize corpus loglikelihood which is roughly speaking the training criterion used by the lm and tm themselves 
a final alternate approach would be to combine weighted joint frequencies rather than conditional estimates ie ci s t w s t co s t suitably normalized such an approach could be simulated by a map style combination in which separate t values were maintained for each t this would make the model more powerful but at the cost of having to learn to downweight out separately for each t which we suspect would require more training data for reliable performance 
to set we used the same criterion as for over a dev corpus the map combination was used for tm probabilities only in part due to a technical difficulty in formulating coherent counts when using standard lm smoothing techniques kneser and ney motivated by information retrieval a number of approaches choose relevant sentence pairs from out by matching individual source sentences from in hildebrand et al l u et al or individual target hypotheses zhao et al 
we obtained positive results using a very simple phrase based system in two different adaptation settings using english french europarl to improve a performance on a small specialized medical domain and using non news portions of the nist training material to improve performance on the news related corpora
