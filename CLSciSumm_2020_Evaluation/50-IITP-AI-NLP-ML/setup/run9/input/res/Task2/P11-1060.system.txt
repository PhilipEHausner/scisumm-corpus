it is impossible to represent the semantics of this phrase with just a csp so we introduce a new aggregate relation notated e consider a tree he ci whose root is connected to a child c via e if the denotation of c is a set of values s the parent s denotation is then a singleton set containing s formally figure a shows the dcs tree for our running example 
our employed zettlemoyer and collins or words work pushes the grounded language agenda towards are given multiple lexical entries kwiatkowski et deeper representations of language think grounded al compositional semantics 
feedback from the context for example the lexical entry for borders world has been used to guide both syntactic parsing is s np np ay ax border x y which means schuler and semantic parsing popescu et borders looks right for the first argument and left al clarke et al 
free from the burden it also allows us to easily add new lexical triggers of annotating logical forms we hope to use our without becoming mired in the semantic formalism techniques in developing even more accurate and quantifiers and superlatives significantly compli broader coverage language understanding systems cate scoping in lambda calculus and often type rais acknowledgments we thank luke zettlemoyer ing needs to be employed 
our learning algorithm alternates between i using the current parameters to generate the k best set zl x for each training example x and ii optimizing the parameters to put probability mass on the correct trees in these sets sets containing no correct answers are skipped
