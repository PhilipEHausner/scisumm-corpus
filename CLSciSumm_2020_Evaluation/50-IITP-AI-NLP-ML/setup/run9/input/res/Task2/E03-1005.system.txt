while sl dop and ls dop have been compared before in bod especially in the context of musical parsing this paper presents the the dop approach is based on two distinctive features the use of corpus fragments rather than grammar rules and the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones 
the derivation with the smallest sum or highest rank is taken as the final best derivation producing the best parse tree in simplicity dop although bod b reports that simplicity dop is outperformed by likelihood dop its results are still rather impressive for such a simple model 
together with a pcfgreduction of dop we obtain improved accuracy and efficiency on the wall street journal treebank our results show an relative reduction in error rate over previous models and an average processing time of seconds per wsj sentence 
in this paper we will test a simple extension of goodman s compact pcfg reduction of dop which has the same property as the normalization proposed in bod in that it assigns roughly equal weight to each node in the training data 
this innovation has not become generally adopted yet many approaches still work either with local trees i e single level rules with limited means of information percolation or with restricted fragments as in stochastic tree adjoining grammar schabes chiang that do not include nonlexicalized fragments 
thus the major innovations of dop are the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones both have gained or are gaining wide usage and are also becoming relevant for theoretical linguistics see bod et al a
