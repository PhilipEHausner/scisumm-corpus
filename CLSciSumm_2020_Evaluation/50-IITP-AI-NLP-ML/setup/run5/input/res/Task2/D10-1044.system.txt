we obtained positive results using a very simple phrase-based system in two different adaptation settings: using english/french europarl to improve a performance on a small, specialized medical domain; and using non-news portions of the nist09 training material to improve performance on the news-related corpora.
this is a standard adaptation problem for smt.
the paper is structured as follows.
for developers of statistical machine translation (smt) systems, an additional complication is the heterogeneous nature of smt components (word-alignment model, language model, translation model, etc.
in future work we plan to try this approach with more competitive smt systems, and to extend instance weighting to other standard smt components such as the lm, lexical phrase weights, and lexicalized distortion.
phrase tables were extracted from the in and out training corpora (not the dev as was used for instance weighting models), and phrase pairs in the intersection of the in and out phrase tables were used as positive examples, with two alternate definitions of negative examples: the classifier trained using the 2nd definition had higher accuracy on a development set.
the first setting uses the european medicines agency (emea) corpus (tiedemann, 2009) as in, and the europarl (ep) corpus (www.statmt.org/europarl) as out, for english/french translation in both directions.
experiments are presented in section 4.
when out is large and distinct, its contribution can be controlled by training separate in and out models, and weighting their combination.
we will also directly compare with a baseline similar to the matsoukas et al approach in order to measure the benefit from weighting phrase pairs (or ngrams) rather than full sentences.
