apart from this rather technical problem, two further arguments speak against phrase structure as the structural pivot of the annotation scheme: finally, the structural handling of free word order means stating well-formedness constraints on structures involving many trace-filler dependencies, which has proved tedious.
we describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages.
consider the german sentence (1) daran wird ihn anna erkennen, &di er weint at-it will him anna recognise that he cries 'anna will recognise him at his cry' a sample constituent structure is given below: the fairly short sentence contains three non-local dependencies, marked by co-references between traces and the corresponding nodes.
the following features of our formalism are then of particular importance: the current tagset comprises only 16 node labels and 34 function tags, yet a. finely grinned classification will take place in the near future.

as the annotation scheme described in this paper focusses on annotating argument structure rather than constituent trees, it differs from existing treebanks in several aspects.
data-drivenness: the scheme must provide representational means for all phenomena occurring in texts.
3 shows the representation of the sentence: (6) sic wurde von preubischen truppen besetzt she was by prussian troops occupied und 1887 dem preuliischen staat angegliedert and 1887 to-the prussian state incorporated 'it was occupied by prussian troops and incorporated into prussia in 1887' the category of the coordination is labeled cvp here, where c stands for coordination, and vp for the actual category.
