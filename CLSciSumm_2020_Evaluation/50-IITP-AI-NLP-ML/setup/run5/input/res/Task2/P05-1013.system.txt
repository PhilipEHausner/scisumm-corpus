we have presented a new method for non-projective dependency parsing, based on a combination of data-driven projective dependency parsing and graph transformation techniques.
in the first part of the experiment, dependency graphs from the treebanks were projectivized using the algorithm described in section 2.
there exist a few robust broad-coverage parsers that produce non-projective dependency structures, notably tapanainen and jÂ¨arvinen (1997) and wang and harper (2004) for english, foth et al. (2004) for german, and holan (2004) for czech.
projectivizing a dependency graph by lifting nonprojective arcs is a nondeterministic operation in the general case.
in section 2 we introduce the graph transformation techniques used to projectivize and deprojectivize dependency graphs, and in section 3 we describe the data-driven dependency parser that is the core of our system.
in this paper, we show how non-projective dependency parsing can be achieved by combining a datadriven projective parser with special graph transformation techniques.
experiments using data from the prague dependency treebank show that the combined system can handle nonprojective constructions with a precision sufficient to yield a significant improvement in overall parsing accuracy.
table 5 shows the overall parsing accuracy attained with the three different encoding schemes, compared to the baseline (no special arc labels) and to training directly on non-projective dependency graphs.
instead, we want to apply an inverse transformation to recover the underlying (nonprojective) dependency graph.
in section 4 we evaluate these transformations with respect to projectivized dependency treebanks, and in section 5 they are applied to parser output.
we call this pseudoprojective dependency parsing, since it is based on a notion of pseudo-projectivity (kahane et al., 1998).
