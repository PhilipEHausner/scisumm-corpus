in this paper we describe and evaluate a method for ranking senses of nouns to obtain the predominant sense of a word using the neighbours from automatically acquired thesauruses.
there has been some related work on using automatic thesauruses for discovering word senses from corpora pantel and lin (2002).
this work was funded by eu-2001-34460 project meaning: developing multilingual web-scale language technologies, uk epsrc project robust accurate statistical parsing (rasp) and a uk epsrc studentship.
the measures provide a similarity score between two wordnet senses ( and ), these being synsets within wordnet. lesk (banerjee and pedersen, 2002) this score maximises the number of overlapping words in the gloss, or definition, of the senses.
in contrast, our work is aimed at discovering the predominant senses from raw text because the first sense heuristic is such a useful one, and because handtagged data is not always available.
we are of course able to apply the method to other versions of wordnet. synset, is incremented with the frequency counts from the corpus of all words belonging to that synset, directly or via the hyponymy relation.
in order to find the predominant sense of a target word we use a thesaurus acquired from automatically parsed text based on the method of lin (1998).
our automatically acquired predominant sense performs nearly as well as the first sense provided by semcor, which is very encouraging given that our method only uses raw text, with no manual labelling.
jiang and conrath specify a distance measure: , where the third class ( ) is the most informative, or most specific, superordinate synset of the two senses and .
