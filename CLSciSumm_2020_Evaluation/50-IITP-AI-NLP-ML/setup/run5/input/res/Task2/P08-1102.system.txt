the perceptron has been used in many nlp tasks, such as pos tagging (collins, 2002), chinese word segmentation (ng and low, 2004; zhang and clark, 2007) and so on.
we propose a cascaded linear model for joint chinese word segmentation and partof-speech tagging.
on the penn chinese treebank 5.0, we obtain an error reduction of segmentation and joint segmentation and part-of-speech tagging over the perceptron-only baseline.
2 segmentation and pos tagging given a chinese character sequence: while the segmentation and pos tagging result can be depicted as: here, ci (i = l.n) denotes chinese character, ti (i = l.m) denotes pos tag, and cl:r (l < r) denotes character sequence ranges from cl to cr.

compared to performing segmentation and pos tagging one at a time, joint s&t can achieve higher accuracy not only on segmentation but also on pos tagging (ng and low, 2004).
the second was conducted on the penn chinese treebank 5.0 (ctb5.0) to test the performance of the cascaded model on segmentation and joint s&t.
we find that the cascaded model achieves a f-measure increment of about 0.5 points on segmentation and about 0.9 points on joint s&t, over the perceptron-only model pos+.
line 4 scans words of all possible lengths l (l = 1.. min(i, k), where i points to the current considering character).
to cope with this problem, we propose a cascaded linear model inspired by the log-linear model (och and ney, 2004) widely used in statistical machine translation to incorporate different kinds of knowledge sources.
