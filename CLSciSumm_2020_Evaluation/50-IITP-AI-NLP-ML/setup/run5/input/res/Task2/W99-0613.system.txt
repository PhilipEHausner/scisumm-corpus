971,746 sentences of new york times text were parsed using the parser of (collins 96).1 word sequences that met the following criteria were then extracted as named entity examples: whose head is a singular noun (tagged nn).
finally, we would like to note that it is possible to devise similar algorithms based with other objective functions than the one given in equ.
several extensions of adaboost for multiclass problems have been suggested (freund and schapire 97; schapire and singer 98).
the task can be considered to be one component of the muc (muc-6, 1995) named entity task (the other task is that of segmentation, i.e., pulling possible people, places and locations from text before sending them to the classifier).
the first method builds on results from (yarowsky 95) and (blum and mitchell 98).
for example, a good classifier would identify mrs. frank as a person, steptoe & johnson as a company, and honduras as a location.
when this feature type was included, coboost chose this default feature at an early iteration, thereby giving non-abstaining pseudo-labels for all examples, with eventual convergence to the two classifiers agreeing by assigning the same label to almost all examples.
in this work we extended the adaboost.mh (schapire and singer 98) algorithm to the cotraining case.
before describing the unsupervised case we first describe the supervised version of the algorithm: input to the learning algorithm: n labeled examples of the form (xi, yâ€ž). y, is the label of the ith example (given that there are k possible labels, y, is a member of y = {1 ... 0). xi is a set of mi features {x,1, xi2 .
