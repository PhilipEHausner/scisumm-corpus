tsarfaty (2006) argues that for semitic languages determining the correct morphological segmentation is dependent on syntactic context and shows that increasing information sharing between the morphological and the syntactic components leads to improved performance on the joint task.
hence, we take the probability of the event fmnh analyzed as rel vb to be this means that we generate f and mnh independently depending on their corresponding pos tags, and the context (as well as the syntactic relation between the two) is modeled via the derivation resulting in a sequence rel vb spanning the form fmnh. based on linear context.
sima’an et al. (2001) presented parsing results for a dop tree-gram model using a small data set (500 sentences) and semiautomatic morphological disambiguation.
tsarfaty and sima’an (2007) have reported state-of-the-art results on hebrew unlexicalized parsing (74.41%) albeit assuming oracle morphological segmentation.
our first model is gtplain, a pcfg learned from the treebank after removing all functional features from the syntactic categories.
cohen and smith (2007) followed up on these results and proposed a system for joint inference of morphological and syntactic structures using factored models each designed and trained on its own.
we use v1.0 mainly because previous studies on joint inference reported results w.r.t. v1.0 only.5 we expect that using the same setup on v2.0 will allow a crosstreebank comparison.6 we used the first 500 sentences as our dev set and the rest 4500 for training and report our main results on this split.
tsarfaty (2006) used a morphological analyzer (segal, 2000), a pos tagger (bar-haim et al., 2005), and a general purpose parser (schmid, 2000) in an integrated framework in which morphological and syntactic components interact to share information, leading to improved performance on the joint task.
