from the discussion so far it is clear that a number of formalisms involve some type of context-free rewriting (they have derivation trees that are local sets).
little attention, however, has been paid to the structural descriptions that these formalisms can assign to strings, i.e. their strong generative capacity.
in the next section, we show how an atm can accept the strings generated by a grammar in a lcfrs formalism in logspace, and hence show that each family can be recognized in polynomial time.
we outlined the definition of a family of constrained grammatical formalisms, called linear context-free rewriting systems.
it is known that cfg's, hg's, and tag's can be recognized in polynomial time since polynomial time algorithms exist in for each of these formalisms.
it is striking that from this point of view many formalisms can be grouped together as having identically structured derivation tree sets.
in considering this aspect of a formalism, we hope to better understand the relationship between the structural descriptions generated by the grammars of a formalism, and the properties of semilinearity and polynomial recognizability.
the independence of paths in the tree sets of the k ti grammatical formalism in this hierarchy can be shown by means of tree pumping lemma of the form t1ti3t .
we loosely describe the class of all such systems as linear context-free rewriting formalisms.
in the remainder of the paper, we outline how a class of linear context-free rewriting systems (lcfrs's) may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows.
although embedding this version of lcfrs's in the framework of ilfp developed by rounds (1985) is straightforward, our motivation was to capture properties shared by a family of grammatical systems and generalize them defining a class of related formalisms.
