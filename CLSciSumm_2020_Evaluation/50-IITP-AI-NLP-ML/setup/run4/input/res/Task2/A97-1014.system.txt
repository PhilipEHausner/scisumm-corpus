we describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages.
apart from this rather technical problem, two further arguments speak against phrase structure as the structural pivot of the annotation scheme: finally, the structural handling of free word order means stating well-formedness constraints on structures involving many trace-filler dependencies, which has proved tedious.
data-drivenness: the scheme must provide representational means for all phenomena occurring in texts.
since a precise structural description of non-constituent coordination would require a. rich inventory of incomplete phrase types, we have agreed on a sort of unde.rspe.cified representations: the coordinated units are assigned structures in which missing lexical material is not represented at the level of primary links.
in general, the resulting interpreted data also are closer to semantic annotation and more neutral with respect to particular syntactic theories.
during the first phase, the focus is on annotating correct structures and a coarse-grained classification of grammatical functions, which represent the following areas of information: dependency type: complements are further classified according to features such as category and case: clausal complements (oc), accusative objects (oa), datives (da), etc.
these differences can be illustrated by a comparison with the penn treebank annotation scheme.
however, some other standard analysts turn out to be problematic, mainly due to the partial, idealised character of competence grammars, which often marginalise or ignore such important. phenomena. as 'deficient' (e.g. headless) constructions, appositions, temporal expressions, etc.
however, full or partial disambiguation takes place in context, and the annotators do not consider unrealistic readings.
this hybrid representation makes the structure less transparent, and therefore more difficult to annotate.
