tsarfaty (2006) argues that for semitic languages determining the correct morphological segmentation is dependent on syntactic context and shows that increasing information sharing between the morphological and the syntactic components leads to improved performance on the joint task.
sima’an et al. (2001) presented parsing results for a dop tree-gram model using a small data set (500 sentences) and semiautomatic morphological disambiguation.
both (tsarfaty, 2006; cohen and smith, 2007) have shown that a single integrated framework outperforms a completely streamlined implementation, yet neither has shown a single generative model which handles both tasks.
tsarfaty (2006) used a morphological analyzer (segal, 2000), a pos tagger (bar-haim et al., 2005), and a general purpose parser (schmid, 2000) in an integrated framework in which morphological and syntactic components interact to share information, leading to improved performance on the joint task.
this analyzer setting is similar to that of (cohen and smith, 2007), and models using it are denoted nohsp, parser and grammar we used bitpar (schmid, 2004), an efficient general purpose parser,10 together with various treebank grammars to parse the input sentences and propose compatible morphological segmentation and syntactic analysis.
evaluating parsing results in our joint framework, as argued by tsarfaty (2006), is not trivial under the joint disambiguation task, as the hypothesized yield need not coincide with the correct one.
the development of the very first hebrew treebank (sima’an et al., 2001) called for the exploration of general statistical parsing methods, but the application was at first limited.
such resources exist for hebrew (itai et al., 2006), but unfortunately use a tagging scheme which is incompatible with the one of the hebrew treebank.s for this reason, we use a data-driven morphological analyzer derived from the training data similar to (cohen and smith, 2007).
