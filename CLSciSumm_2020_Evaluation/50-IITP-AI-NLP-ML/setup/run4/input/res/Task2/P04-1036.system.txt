in contrast, our work is aimed at discovering the predominant senses from raw text because the first sense heuristic is such a useful one, and because handtagged data is not always available.
in this paper we describe and evaluate a method for ranking senses of nouns to obtain the predominant sense of a word using the neighbours from automatically acquired thesauruses.
in order to find the predominant sense of a target word we use a thesaurus acquired from automatically parsed text based on the method of lin (1998).
we present work on the use of a thesaurus acquired from raw textual corpora and the wordnet similarity package to find predominant noun senses automatically.
the automatically acquired predominant senses were evaluated against the hand-tagged resources semcor and the senseval-2 english all-words task giving us a wsd precision of 64% on an all-nouns task.
sections 3 and 4 concern experiments using predominant senses from the bnc evaluated against the data in semcor and the senseval-2 english all-words task respectively.
the measures provide a similarity score between two wordnet senses ( and ), these being synsets within wordnet. lesk (banerjee and pedersen, 2002) this score maximises the number of overlapping words in the gloss, or definition, of the senses.
our automatically acquired predominant sense performs nearly as well as the first sense provided by semcor, which is very encouraging given that our method only uses raw text, with no manual labelling.
whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense-tagged corpus such as semcor is clearly useful, there is a strong case for obtaining a first, or predominant, sense from untagged corpus data so that a wsd system can be tuned to the genre or domain at hand.
