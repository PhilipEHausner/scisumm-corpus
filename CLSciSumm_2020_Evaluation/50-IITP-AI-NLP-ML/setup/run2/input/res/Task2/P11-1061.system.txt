altun et al. (2005) proposed a technique that uses graph based similarity between labeled and unlabeled parts of structured data in a discriminative framework for semi-supervised learning.
as discussed in more detail in ยง3, we use two types of vertices in our graph: on the foreign language side vertices correspond to trigram types, while the vertices on the english side are individual word types.
we describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part-of-speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language.
for each trigram type x2 x3 x4 in a sequence x1 x2 x3 x4 x5, we count how many times that trigram type co-occurs with the different instantiations of each concept, and compute the point-wise mutual information (pmi) between the two.5 the similarity between two trigram types is given by summing over the pmi values over feature instantiations that they have in common.
second, we treat the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model (ยง5), rather than using them directly for supervised training.
for each language under consideration, petrov et al. (2011) provide a mapping a from the fine-grained language specific pos tags in the foreign treebank to the universal pos tags.
the foreign language vertices (denoted by vf) correspond to foreign trigram types, exactly as in subramanya et al. (2010).
we use graph-based label propagation for cross-lingual knowledge transfer and use the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model (berg- kirkpatrick et al., 2010).
furthermore, we do not connect the english vertices to each other, but only to foreign language vertices.4 the graph vertices are extracted from the different sides of a parallel corpus (de, df) and an additional unlabeled monolingual foreign corpus ff, which will be used later for training.
