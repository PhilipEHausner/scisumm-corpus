from the discussion so far it is clear that a number of formalisms involve some type of context-free rewriting (they have derivation trees that are local sets).
in considering the relationship between formalisms, we show that it is useful to abstract away from the details of the formalism, and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees. find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by context-free grammars on the basis of this observation, we describe a class of formalisms which we call linear context- free rewriting systems, and show they are recognizable in polynomial time and generate only semilinear languages.
in the next section, we show how an atm can accept the strings generated by a grammar in a lcfrs formalism in logspace, and hence show that each family can be recognized in polynomial time.
a geometrical progression of language families defined by weir (1987) involves tree sets with increasingly complex path sets.
in the remainder of the paper, we outline how a class of linear context-free rewriting systems (lcfrs's) may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows.
it is striking that from this point of view many formalisms can be grouped together as having identically structured derivation tree sets.
semilinearity and the closely related constant growth property (a consequence of semilinearity) have been discussed in the context of grammars for natural languages by joshi (1983/85) and berwick and weinberg (1984).
