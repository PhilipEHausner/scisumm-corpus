in this paper we describe and evaluate a method for ranking senses of nouns to obtain the predominant sense of a word using the neighbours from automatically acquired thesauruses.
the first sense heuristic which is often used as a baseline for supervised wsd systems outperforms many of these systems which take surrounding context into account.
this work was funded by eu-2001-34460 project meaning: developing multilingual web-scale language technologies, uk epsrc project robust accurate statistical parsing (rasp) and a uk epsrc studentship.
for the experiments in sections 3 and 4 we used the 90 million words of written english from the bnc.
whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense-tagged corpus such as semcor is clearly useful, there is a strong case for obtaining a first, or predominant, sense from untagged corpus data so that a wsd system can be tuned to the genre or domain at hand.
we briefly summarise the two measures here; for a more detailed summary see (patwardhan et al., 2003).
in many cases the sense ranking provided in semcor differs to that obtained automatically because we used the bnc to produce our thesaurus.
lapata and brew (2004) have recently also highlighted the importance of a good prior in wsd.
if is the set of co-occurrence types such that is positive then the similarity between two nouns, and , can be computed as: where: a thesaurus entry of size for a target noun is then defined as the most similar nouns to .
we are currently investigating the performance of the first sense heuristic, and this method, for other pos on senseval-3 data (mccarthy et al., 2004), although not yet with rankings from domain specific corpora.
