however, some other standard analysts turn out to be problematic, mainly due to the partial, idealised character of competence grammars, which often marginalise or ignore such important. phenomena. as 'deficient' (e.g. headless) constructions, appositions, temporal expressions, etc.
in general, the resulting interpreted data also are closer to semantic annotation and more neutral with respect to particular syntactic theories.
consider the german sentence (1) daran wird ihn anna erkennen, &di er weint at-it will him anna recognise that he cries 'anna will recognise him at his cry' a sample constituent structure is given below: the fairly short sentence contains three non-local dependencies, marked by co-references between traces and the corresponding nodes.
the following features of our formalism are then of particular importance: the current tagset comprises only 16 node labels and 34 function tags, yet a. finely grinned classification will take place in the near future.

as the annotation scheme described in this paper focusses on annotating argument structure rather than constituent trees, it differs from existing treebanks in several aspects.
the development of linguistically interpreted corpora presents a laborious and time-consuming task.
3 shows the representation of the sentence: (6) sic wurde von preubischen truppen besetzt she was by prussian troops occupied und 1887 dem preuliischen staat angegliedert and 1887 to-the prussian state incorporated 'it was occupied by prussian troops and incorporated into prussia in 1887' the category of the coordination is labeled cvp here, where c stands for coordination, and vp for the actual category.
