to compare with others conveniently, we excluded the ones forbidden by the close test regulation of sighan, for example, pu(c0), indicating whether character c0 is a punctuation.
the second was conducted on the penn chinese treebank 5.0 (ctb5.0) to test the performance of the cascaded model on segmentation and joint s&t.
on the penn chinese treebank 5.0, we obtain an error reduction of segmentation and joint segmentation and part-of-speech tagging over the perceptron-only baseline.
2 segmentation and pos tagging given a chinese character sequence: while the segmentation and pos tagging result can be depicted as: here, ci (i = l.n) denotes chinese character, ti (i = l.m) denotes pos tag, and cl:r (l < r) denotes character sequence ranges from cl to cr.

since the typical approach of discriminative models treats segmentation as a labelling problem by assigning each character a boundary tag (xue and shen, 2003), joint s&t can be conducted in a labelling fashion by expanding boundary tags to include pos information (ng and low, 2004).
the perceptron algorithm introduced into nlp by collins (2002), is a simple but effective discriminative training method.
experiments show that the cascaded model achieves improved accuracies on both segmentation only and joint segmentation and part-of-speech tagging.
we called them non-lexical-target because predications derived from them can predicate without considering the current character c0.
to cope with this problem, we propose a cascaded linear model inspired by the log-linear model (och and ney, 2004) widely used in statistical machine translation to incorporate different kinds of knowledge sources.
