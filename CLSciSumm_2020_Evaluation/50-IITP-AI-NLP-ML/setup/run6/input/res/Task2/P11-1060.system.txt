it is impossible to represent the semantics of this phrase with just a csp so we introduce a new aggregate relation notated e consider a tree he ci whose root is connected to a child c via e if the denotation of c is a set of values s the parent s denotation is then a singleton set containing s formally figure a shows the dcs tree for our running example 
our employed zettlemoyer and collins or words work pushes the grounded language agenda towards are given multiple lexical entries kwiatkowski et deeper representations of language think grounded al compositional semantics 
these rules are often too stringent cused on aligning text to a world liang et al and for complex utterances especially in free word using text in reinforcement learning branavan et al order languages either disharmonic combinators are branavan et al and many others 
think of dcs as a higher level our system learns lexical associations between programming language tailored to natural language words and predicates 
the main technical contribution of this work is a new semantic representation dependency based compositional semantics dcs which is both simple and expressive section 
ccg is one instantiation steedman which is used by many semantic parsers e g zettlemoyer and collins 
trace inspired by discourse representation theory drt predicates can be inserted anywhere but the fea kamp and reyle kamp et al where tures favor some insertions depending on the words variables are discourse referents 
answering these types of complex questions compositionally involves first mapping the questions into logical forms semantic parsing
