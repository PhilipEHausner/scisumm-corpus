we have presented a new method for non projective dependency parsing based on a combination of data driven projective dependency parsing and graph transformation techniques 
the last four columns in table show the distribution of nonprojective arcs with respect to the number of lifts required 
however since we want to preserve as much of the original structure as possible we are interested in finding a transformation that involves a minimal number of lifts 
it is worth noting that although nonprojective constructions are less frequent in ddt than in pdt they seem to be more deeply nested since only about can be projectivized with a single lift while almost of the non projective arcs in pdt only require a single lift 
experiments using data from the prague dependency treebank show that the combined system can handle nonprojective constructions with a precision sufficient to yield a significant improvement in overall parsing accuracy 
in this paper we show how non projective dependency parsing can be achieved by combining a datadriven projective parser with special graph transformation techniques 
in approaching this problem a variety of different methods are conceivable including a more or less sophisticated use of machine learning 
the overall parsing accuracy obtained with the pseudo projective approach is still lower than for the best projective parsers 
projectivizing a dependency graph by lifting nonprojective arcs is a nondeterministic operation in the general case 
this may seem surprising given the experiments reported in section but the explanation is probably that the non projective dependencies that can be recovered at all are of the simple kind that only requires a single lift where the encoding of path information is often redundant
