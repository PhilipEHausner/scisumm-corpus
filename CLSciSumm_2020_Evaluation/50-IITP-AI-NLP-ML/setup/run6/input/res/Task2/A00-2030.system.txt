we have demonstrated at least for one problem that a lexicalized probabilistic context free parser with head rules lpcfghr can be used effectively for information extraction 
we were already using a generative statistical model for part of speech tagging weischedel et al and more recently had begun using a generative statistical model for name finding bikel et al 
since a few statistical parsing algorithms have demonstrated a breakthrough in parsing accuracy as measured against the upenn treebank as a gold standard 
at each step in the process a choice is made from a statistical distribution with the probability of each possible selection dependent on particular features of previously generated elements 
in these trees the standard treebank structures are augmented to convey semantic information that is entities and relations 
in this paper we report adapting a lexicalized probabilistic context free parser with head rules lpcfg hr to information extraction 
whenever two or more constituents are equivalent relative to all possible later parsing decisions we apply dynamic programming keeping only the most likely constituent in the chart 
chiba was able to use such a parsing algorithm to reduce perplexity with the long term goal of improved speech recognition 
in this section we describe the algorithm that was used to automatically produce augmented trees starting with a human generated semantic annotations and b machinegenerated syntactic parse trees 
for the following example the template relation in figure was to be generated quot donald m goldstein a historian at the university of pittsburgh who helped write quot
