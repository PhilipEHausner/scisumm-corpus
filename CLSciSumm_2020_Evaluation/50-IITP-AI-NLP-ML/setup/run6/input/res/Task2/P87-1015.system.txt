little attention however has been paid to the structural descriptions that these formalisms can assign to strings i e their strong generative capacity 
for example gazdar discusses the applicability of indexed grammars ig s to natural language in terms of the structural descriptions assigned and berwick discusses the strong generative capacity of lexical functional grammar lfg and government and bindings grammars gb 
the independence of paths in the tree sets of the k ti grammatical formalism in this hierarchy can be shown by means of tree pumping lemma of the form t ti t 
although embedding this version of lcfrs s in the framework of ilfp developed by rounds is straightforward our motivation was to capture properties shared by a family of grammatical systems and generalize them defining a class of related formalisms 
we outlined the definition of a family of constrained grammatical formalisms called linear context free rewriting systems 
in considering this aspect of a formalism we hope to better understand the relationship between the structural descriptions generated by the grammars of a formalism and the properties of semilinearity and polynomial recognizability 
having defined lcfrs s in section we established the semilinearity and hence constant growth property of the languages generated 
for example in tag s a derived auxiliary tree spans two substrings to the left and right of the foot node and the adjunction operation inserts another substring spanned by the subtree under the node where adjunction takes place between them see figure 
it is striking that from this point of view many formalisms can be grouped together as having identically structured derivation tree sets
