in general the resulting interpreted data also are closer to semantic annotation and more neutral with respect to particular syntactic theories 
we describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non configurational languages 
this hybrid representation makes the structure less transparent and therefore more difficult to annotate 
for the implementation we used tcl tk version 
apart from this rather technical problem two further arguments speak against phrase structure as the structural pivot of the annotation scheme finally the structural handling of free word order means stating well formedness constraints on structures involving many trace filler dependencies which has proved tedious 
owing to the partial automation the average annotation efficiency improves by from around minutes to minutes per sentence 
data drivenness the scheme must provide representational means for all phenomena occurring in texts 
since a precise structural description of non constituent coordination would require a rich inventory of incomplete phrase types we have agreed on a sort of unde rspe cified representations the coordinated units are assigned structures in which missing lexical material is not represented at the level of primary links 
during the first phase the focus is on annotating correct structures and a coarse grained classification of grammatical functions which represent the following areas of information dependency type complements are further classified according to features such as category and case clausal complements oc accusative objects oa datives da etc 
however full or partial disambiguation takes place in context and the annotators do not consider unrealistic readings
