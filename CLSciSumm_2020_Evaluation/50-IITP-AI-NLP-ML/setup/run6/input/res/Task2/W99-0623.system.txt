the precision and recall measures described in more detail in section used in evaluating treebank parsing treat each constituent as a separate entity a minimal unit of correctness 
the combining algorithm is presented with the candidate parses and asked to choose which one is best 
the bayes models were able to achieve significantly higher precision than their non parametric counterparts 
the counts represent portions of the approximately constituents hypothesized by the parsers in the development set 
we plan to explore more powerful techniques for exploiting the diversity of parsing methods 
for our experiments we also report the mean of precision and recall which we denote by p r i and f measure 
in equations through we develop the model for constructing our parse using na ve bayes classification 
the maximum precision oracle is an upper bound on the possible gain we can achieve by parse hybridization 
these three parsers have given the best reported parsing results on the penn treebank wall street journal corpus marcus et al 
our original hope in combining these parsers is that their errors are independently distributed 
through parser combination we have reduced the precision error rate by and the recall error rate by compared to the best previously published result 
the corpus based statistical parsing community has many fast and accurate automated parsing systems including systems produced by collins charniak and ratnaparkhi 
another way to interpret this is that less than of the correct constituents are missing from the hypotheses generated by the union of the three parsers
