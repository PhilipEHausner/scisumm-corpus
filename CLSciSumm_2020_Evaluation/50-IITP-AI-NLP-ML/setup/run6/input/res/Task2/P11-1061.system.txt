second we treat the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model rather than using them directly for supervised training 
unfortunately the best completely unsupervised english pos tagger that does not make use of a tagging dictionary reaches only accuracy christodoulopoulos et al making its practical usability questionable at best 
our method does not assume any knowledge about the target language in particular no tagging dictionary is assumed making it applicable to a wide array of resource poor languages 
given the bilingual graph described in the previous section we can use label propagation to project the english pos labels to the foreign language 
since our graph is built from a parallel corpus we can use standard word alignment techniques to align the english sentences de note that many combinations are impossible giving a pmi value of e g when the trigram type and the feature instantiation don t have words in common and their foreign language translations df label propagation in the graph will provide coverage and high recall and we therefore extract only intersected high confidence alignments de f 
our results outperform strong unsupervised baselines as well as approaches that rely on direct projections and bridge the gap between purely supervised and unsupervised pos tagging models 
for each language under consideration petrov et al provide a mapping a from the fine grained language specific pos tags in the foreign treebank to the universal pos tags 
we describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part of speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data but have translated text in a resource rich language
