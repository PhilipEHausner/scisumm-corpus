tsarfaty and sima an have reported state of the art results on hebrew unlexicalized parsing albeit assuming oracle morphological segmentation 
secondly for all our models we provide better fine and coarse grained pos tagging accuracy and all pruned models outperform the oracle results reported by them in terms of syntactic disambiguation even the simplest grammar pruned with hspell outperforms their non oracle results 
our first model is gtplain a pcfg learned from the treebank after removing all functional features from the syntactic categories 
tsarfaty argues that for semitic languages determining the correct morphological segmentation is dependent on syntactic context and shows that increasing information sharing between the morphological and the syntactic components leads to improved performance on the joint task 
we conjecture that this trend may continue by incorporating additional information e g three dimensional models as proposed by tsarfaty and sima an 
sima an et al presented parsing results for a dop tree gram model using a small data set sentences and semiautomatic morphological disambiguation 
hence we take the probability of the event fmnh analyzed as rel vb to be this means that we generate f and mnh independently depending on their corresponding pos tags and the context as well as the syntactic relation between the two is modeled via the derivation resulting in a sequence rel vb spanning the form fmnh based on linear context 
both tsarfaty cohen and smith have shown that a single integrated framework outperforms a completely streamlined implementation yet neither has shown a single generative model which handles both tasks
