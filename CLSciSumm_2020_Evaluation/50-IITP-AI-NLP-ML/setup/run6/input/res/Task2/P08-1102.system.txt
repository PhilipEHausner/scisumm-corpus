the perceptron has been used in many nlp tasks such as pos tagging collins chinese word segmentation ng and low zhang and clark and so on 
as shown in figure the character based perceptron is used as the inside layer linear model and sends its output to the outside layer 
on the penn chinese treebank we obtain an error reduction of segmentation and joint segmentation and part of speech tagging over the perceptron only baseline 
the second was conducted on the penn chinese treebank ctb to test the performance of the cascaded model on segmentation and joint s t 
we propose a cascaded linear model for joint chinese word segmentation and partof speech tagging 
compared to performing segmentation and pos tagging one at a time joint s t can achieve higher accuracy not only on segmentation but also on pos tagging ng and low 
as all the sub models including the perceptron are regarded as separate features of the outside layer linear model we can train them respectively with special algorithms 
finally the word count penalty gives improvement to the cascaded model points on segmentation and points on joint s t 
we find that the cascaded model achieves a f measure increment of about points on segmentation and about points on joint s t over the perceptron only model pos 
according to ng and low the segmentation task can be transformed to a tagging problem by assigning each character a boundary tag of the following four types we can extract segmentation result by splitting the labelled result into subsequences of pattern s or bm e which denote single character word and multicharacter word respectively
