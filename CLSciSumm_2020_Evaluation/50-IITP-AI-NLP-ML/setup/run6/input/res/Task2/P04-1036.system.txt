the problem with using the predominant or first sense heuristic aside from the fact that it does not take surrounding context into account is that it assumes some quantity of handtagged data 
in contrast our work is aimed at discovering the predominant senses from raw text because the first sense heuristic is such a useful one and because handtagged data is not always available 
if is the set of co occurrence types such that is positive then the similarity between two nouns and can be computed as where a thesaurus entry of size for a target noun is then defined as the most similar nouns to 
there has been some related work on using automatic thesauruses for discovering word senses from corpora pantel and lin 
sections and concern experiments using predominant senses from the bnc evaluated against the data in semcor and the senseval english all words task respectively 
for the experiments in sections and we used the million words of written english from the bnc 
we believe that an automatic means of finding a predominant sense would be useful for systems that use it as a means of backing off wilks and stevenson hoste et al and for systems that use it in lexical acquisition mccarthy merlo and leybold korhonen because of the limited size of hand tagged resources 
we experiment with several wordnet similarity measures patwardhan and pedersen which aim to capture semantic relatedness within
in this paper we describe and evaluate a method for ranking senses of nouns to obtain the predominant sense of a word using the neighbours from automatically acquired thesauruses
