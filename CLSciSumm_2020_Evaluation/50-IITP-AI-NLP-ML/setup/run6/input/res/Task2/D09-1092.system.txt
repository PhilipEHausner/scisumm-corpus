the polylingual topic model pltm is an extension of latent dirichlet allocation lda blei et al for modeling polylingual document tuples 
in this paper we present the polylingual topic model pltm 
topic models are a useful tool for analyzing large text collections but have previously been applied in only monolingual or at most bilingual contexts 
an important application for polylingual topic modeling is to use small numbers of comparable document tuples to link topics in larger collections of distinct non comparable documents in multiple languages 
we argue that topic modeling is both a useful and appropriate tool for leveraging correspondences between semantically comparable documents in multiple different languages 
outside of the field of topic modeling kawaba et al kawaba et al use a wikipedia based model to perform sentiment analysis of blog posts 
we introduced a polylingual topic model pltm that discovers topics aligned across multiple languages 
bilingual topic models for parallel texts with word to word alignments have been studied previously using the hm bitam model zhao and xing 
one simple way to achieve this topic alignment is to add a small set of comparable document tuples that provide sufficient glue to bind the topics together 
we take a simpler approach that is more suitable for topically similar document tuples where documents are not direct translations of one another in more than two languages 
topic models have been used for analyzing topic trends in research literature mann et al hall et al inferring captions for images blei and jordan social network analysis in email mccallum et al and expanding queries with topically related words in information retrieval wei and croft
