thus the major innovations of dop are the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones both have gained or are gaining wide usage and are also becoming relevant for theoretical linguistics see bod et al a 
the derivation with the smallest sum or highest rank is taken as the final best derivation producing the best parse tree in simplicity dop although bod b reports that simplicity dop is outperformed by likelihood dop its results are still rather impressive for such a simple model 
but even with cross validation ml dop is outperformed by the much simpler dop model on both the atis and ovis treebanks bod b 
goodman s main theorem is that this construction produces pcfg derivations isomorphic to dop derivations with equal probability 
this innovation has not become generally adopted yet many approaches still work either with local trees i e single level rules with limited means of information percolation or with restricted fragments as in stochastic tree adjoining grammar schabes chiang that do not include nonlexicalized fragments 
while sl dop and ls dop have been compared before in bod especially in the context of musical parsing this paper presents the the dop approach is based on two distinctive features the use of corpus fragments rather than grammar rules and the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones 
in bod b an alternative notion for the best parse tree was proposed based on a simplicity criterion instead of producing the most probable tree this model produced the tree generated by the shortest derivation with the fewest training subtrees
