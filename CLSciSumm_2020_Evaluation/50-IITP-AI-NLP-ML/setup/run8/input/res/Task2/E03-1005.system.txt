while sl-dop and ls-dop have been compared before in bod (2002), especially in the context of musical parsing, this paper presents the the dop approach is based on two distinctive features: (1) the use of corpus fragments rather than grammar rules, and (2) the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones.
together with a pcfgreduction of dop we obtain improved accuracy and efficiency on the wall street journal treebank our results show an 11% relative reduction in error rate over previous models, and an average processing time of 3.6 seconds per wsj sentence.
this may be explained by the fact our best results in bod (2001) were obtained by testing various subtree restrictions until the highest accuracy was obtained, while in the current experiment we used all subtrees as given by the pcfg-reduction.
the derivation with the smallest sum, or highest rank, is taken as the final best derivation producing the best parse tree in simplicity-dop.3 although bod (2000b) reports that simplicity dop is outperformed by likelihood-dop, its results are still rather impressive for such a simple model.
then we slightly modify the pcfg-reduction in figure 2 as follows: we will also test the proposal by bonnema et al. (1999) which reduces the probability of a subtree by a factor of two for each non-root nonterminal it contains.
this innovation has not become generally adopted yet: many approaches still work either with local trees, i.e. single level rules with limited means of information percolation, or with restricted fragments, as in stochastic tree-adjoining grammar (schabes 1992; chiang 2000) that do not include nonlexicalized fragments.
