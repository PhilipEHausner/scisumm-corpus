during the first phase, the focus is on annotating correct structures and a coarse-grained classification of grammatical functions, which represent the following areas of information: dependency type: complements are further classified according to features such as category and case: clausal complements (oc), accusative objects (oa), datives (da), etc.
as modern linguistics is also becoming more aware of the importance of larger sets of naturally occurring data., interpreted corpora. are a. valuable resource for theoretical and descriptive linguistic research.
3 shows the representation of the sentence: (6) sic wurde von preubischen truppen besetzt she was by prussian troops occupied und 1887 dem preuliischen staat angegliedert and 1887 to-the prussian state incorporated 'it was occupied by prussian troops and incorporated into prussia in 1887' the category of the coordination is labeled cvp here, where c stands for coordination, and vp for the actual category.
the following features of our formalism are then of particular importance: the current tagset comprises only 16 node labels and 34 function tags, yet a. finely grinned classification will take place in the near future.

to keep the human annotator from missing errors made by the tagger, we additionally calculate the strongest competitor for each label g. if its probability is close to the winner (closeness is defined by a threshold on the quotient), the assignment is regarded as unreliable, and the annotator is asked to confirm the assignment.
