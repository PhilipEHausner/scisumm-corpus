we present a new parser for parsing down to penn tree-bank style parse trees [16] that achieves 90.1% average precision/recall for sentences of length < 40, and 89.5% for sentences of length < 100, when trained and tested on the previously established [5,9,10,15,17] &quot;standard&quot; sections of the wall street journal tree-bank.
it makes no use of special maximum-entropyinspired features (though their presence made it much easier to perform these experiments), it does not guess the pre-terminal before guessing the lexical head, and it uses a tree-bank grammar rather than a markov grammar.
now consider computing a conditional probability p(a h) with a set of features h that connect a to the history h. in a log-linear model the probability function takes the following form: here the ai are weights between negative and positive infinity that indicate the relative importance of a feature: the more relevant the feature to the value of the probability, the higher the absolute value of the associated a.
that the previous three best parsers on this test [5,9,17] all perform within a percentage point of each other, despite quite different basic mechanisms, led some researchers to wonder if there might be some maximum level of parsing performance that could be obtained using the treebank for training, and to conjecture that perhaps we were at it.
from our perspective, perhaps the two most important numbers to come out of this research are the overall error reduction of 13% over the results in [9] and the intermediateresult improvement of nearly 2% on labeled precision/recall due to the simple idea of guessing the head's pre-terminal before guessing the head.
