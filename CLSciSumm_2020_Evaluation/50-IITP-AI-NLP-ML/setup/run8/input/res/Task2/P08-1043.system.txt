a less canonical representation of segmental morphology is triggered by a morpho-phonological process of omitting the definite article h when occurring after the particles b or l. this process triggers ambiguity as for the definiteness status of nouns following these particles.we refer to such cases in which the concatenation of elements does not strictly correspond to the original surface form as super-segmental morphology.
hence, we take the probability of the event fmnh analyzed as rel vb to be this means that we generate f and mnh independently depending on their corresponding pos tags, and the context (as well as the syntactic relation between the two) is modeled via the derivation resulting in a sequence rel vb spanning the form fmnh. based on linear context.
a compatible view is presented by charniak et al. (1996) who consider the kind of probabilities a generative parser should get from a pos tagger, and concludes that these should be p(w|t) “and nothing fancier”.3 in our setting, therefore, the lattice is not used to induce a probability distribution on a linear context, but rather, it is used as a common-denominator of state-indexation of all segmentations possibilities of a surface form.
this analyzer setting is similar to that of (cohen and smith, 2007), and models using it are denoted nohsp, parser and grammar we used bitpar (schmid, 2004), an efficient general purpose parser,10 together with various treebank grammars to parse the input sentences and propose compatible morphological segmentation and syntactic analysis.
to evaluate the performance on the segmentation task, we report seg, the standard harmonic means for segmentation precision and recall f1 (as defined in bar-haim et al. (2005); tsarfaty (2006)) as well as the segmentation accuracy segtok measure indicating the percentage of input tokens assigned the correct exact segmentation (as reported by cohen and smith (2007)).
