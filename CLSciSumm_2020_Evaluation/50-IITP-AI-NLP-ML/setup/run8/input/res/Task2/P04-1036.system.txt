we are of course able to apply the method to other versions of wordnet. synset, is incremented with the frequency counts from the corpus of all words belonging to that synset, directly or via the hyponymy relation.
lapata and brew obtain their priors for verb classes directly from subcategorisation evidence in a parsed corpus, whereas we use parsed data to find distributionally similar words (nearest neighbours) to the target word which reflect the different senses of the word and have associated distributional similarity scores which can be used for ranking the senses according to prevalence.
this work was funded by eu-2001-34460 project meaning: developing multilingual web-scale language technologies, uk epsrc project robust accurate statistical parsing (rasp) and a uk epsrc studentship.
the measures provide a similarity score between two wordnet senses ( and ), these being synsets within wordnet. lesk (banerjee and pedersen, 2002) this score maximises the number of overlapping words in the gloss, or definition, of the senses.
we see that both domains have a similarly high percentage of factotum (domain independent) labels, but as we would expect, the other peaks correspond to the economy label for the finance corpus, and the sports label for the sports corpus. inant senses for 38 polysemous words ranked using the sports and finance corpus.
we are currently investigating the performance of the first sense heuristic, and this method, for other pos on senseval-3 data (mccarthy et al., 2004), although not yet with rankings from domain specific corpora.
we believe that an automatic means of finding a predominant sense would be useful for systems that use it as a means of backing-off (wilks and stevenson, 1998; hoste et al., 2001) and for systems that use it in lexical acquisition (mccarthy, 1997; merlo and leybold, 2001; korhonen, 2002) because of the limited size of hand-tagged resources.
