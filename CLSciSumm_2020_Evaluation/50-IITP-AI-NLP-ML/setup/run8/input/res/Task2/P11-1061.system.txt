we use the universal pos tagset of petrov et al. (2011) in our experiments.10 this set c consists of the following 12 coarse-grained tags: noun (nouns), verb (verbs), adj (adjectives), adv (adverbs), pron (pronouns), det (determiners), adp (prepositions or postpositions), num (numerals), conj (conjunctions), prt (particles), punc (punctuation marks) and x (a catch-all for other categories such as abbreviations or foreign words).
to bridge this gap, we consider a practically motivated scenario, in which we want to leverage existing resources from a resource-rich language (like english) when building tools for resource-poor foreign languages.1 we assume that absolutely no labeled training data is available for the foreign language of interest, but that we have access to parallel data with a resource-rich language.
we describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part-of-speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language.
for each trigram type x2 x3 x4 in a sequence x1 x2 x3 x4 x5, we count how many times that trigram type co-occurs with the different instantiations of each concept, and compute the point-wise mutual information (pmi) between the two.5 the similarity between two trigram types is given by summing over the pmi values over feature instantiations that they have in common.
since our graph is built from a parallel corpus, we can use standard word alignment techniques to align the english sentences de 5note that many combinations are impossible giving a pmi value of 0; e.g., when the trigram type and the feature instantiation don’t have words in common. and their foreign language translations df.6 label propagation in the graph will provide coverage and high recall, and we therefore extract only intersected high-confidence (> 0.9) alignments de�f.
