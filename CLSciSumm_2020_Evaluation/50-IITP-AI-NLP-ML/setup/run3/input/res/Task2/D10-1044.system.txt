this is a standard adaptation problem for smt 
the linear lm lin lm tm lin tm and map tm map tm used with non adapted counterparts perform in all cases slightly worse than the log linear combination which adapts both lm and tm components 
it is also worth pointing out a connection with daum e s work that splits each feature into domain specific and general copies 
moving beyond directly related work major themes in smt adaptation include the ir hildebrand et al l u et al zhao et al and mixture finch and sumita foster and kuhn koehn and schroeder l u et al approaches for lms and tms described above as well as methods for exploiting monolingual in domain text typically by translating it automatically and then performing self training bertoldi and federico ueffing et al schwenk and senellart 
we obtained positive results using a very simple phrase based system in two different adaptation settings using english french europarl to improve a performance on a small specialized medical domain and using non news portions of the nist training material to improve performance on the news related corpora 
the nd block contains the ir system which was tuned by selecting text in multiples of the size of the emea training corpus according to dev set performance 
in future work we plan to try this approach with more competitive smt systems and to extend instance weighting to other standard smt components such as the lm lexical phrase weights and lexicalized distortion
