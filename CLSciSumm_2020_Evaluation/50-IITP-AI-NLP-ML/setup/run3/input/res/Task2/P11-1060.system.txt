to further reduce the search space f imposes a few additional constraints e g limiting the number of marked nodes to and only allowing trace predicates between arity predicates 
trace inspired by discourse representation theory drt predicates can be inserted anywhere but the fea kamp and reyle kamp et al where tures favor some insertions depending on the words variables are discourse referents 
feedback from the context for example the lexical entry for borders world has been used to guide both syntactic parsing is s np np ay ax border x y which means schuler and semantic parsing popescu et borders looks right for the first argument and left al clarke et al 
rather than using lexical triggers several of the other systems use ibm word alignment models to produce an initial word predicate mapping 
this algorithm is linear in the number of nodes times the size of the denotations now the dual importance of trees in dcs is clear we have seen that trees parallel syntactic dependency structure which will facilitate parsing 
it is impossible to represent the semantics of this phrase with just a csp so we introduce a new aggregate relation notated e consider a tree he ci whose root is connected to a child c via e if the denotation of c is a set of values s the parent s denotation is then a singleton set containing s formally figure a shows the dcs tree for our running example 
our employed zettlemoyer and collins or words work pushes the grounded language agenda towards are given multiple lexical entries kwiatkowski et deeper representations of language think grounded al compositional semantics
