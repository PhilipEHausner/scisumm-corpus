the first sense heuristic which is often used as a baseline for supervised wsd systems outperforms many of these systems which take surrounding context into account 
whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense tagged corpus such as semcor is clearly useful there is a strong case for obtaining a first or predominant sense from untagged corpus data so that a wsd system can be tuned to the genre or domain at hand 
if is the set of co occurrence types such that is positive then the similarity between two nouns and can be computed as where a thesaurus entry of size for a target noun is then defined as the most similar nouns to 
in many cases the sense ranking provided in semcor differs to that obtained automatically because we used the bnc to produce our thesaurus 
jiang and conrath specify a distance measure where the third class is the most informative or most specific superordinate synset of the two senses and 
the problem with using the predominant or first sense heuristic aside from the fact that it does not take surrounding context into account is that it assumes some quantity of handtagged data 
in contrast our work is aimed at discovering the predominant senses from raw text because the first sense heuristic is such a useful one and because handtagged data is not always available 
we generated a thesaurus entry for all polysemous nouns which occurred in semcor with a frequency and in the bnc with a frequency in the grammatical relations listed in section above
