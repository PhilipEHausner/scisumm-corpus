in general the resulting interpreted data also are closer to semantic annotation and more neutral with respect to particular syntactic theories 
the development of linguistically interpreted corpora presents a laborious and time consuming task 
however some other standard analysts turn out to be problematic mainly due to the partial idealised character of competence grammars which often marginalise or ignore such important phenomena as deficient e g headless constructions appositions temporal expressions etc 
in addition a number of clear cut np cornponents can be defined outside that juxtapositional kernel pre and postnominal genitives gl gr relative clauses rc clausal and sentential complements oc 
a uniform representation of local and non local dependencies makes the structure more transparent 
the following features of our formalism are then of particular importance the current tagset comprises only node labels and function tags yet a finely grinned classification will take place in the near future 
as the annotation scheme described in this paper focusses on annotating argument structure rather than constituent trees it differs from existing treebanks in several aspects 
a problem for the rudimentary argument structure representations is the use of incomplete structures in natural language i e phenomena such as coordination and ellipsis 
sentences annotated in previous steps are used as training material for further processing 
this assumption underlies a growing number of recent syntactic theories which give up the context free constituent backbone cf 
owing to the partial automation the average annotation efficiency improves by from around minutes to minutes per sentence
