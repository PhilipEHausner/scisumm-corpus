 segmentation and pos tagging given a chinese character sequence while the segmentation and pos tagging result can be depicted as here ci i l n denotes chinese character ti i l m denotes pos tag and cl r l r denotes character sequence ranges from cl to cr 
to compare with others conveniently we excluded the ones forbidden by the close test regulation of sighan for example pu c indicating whether character c is a punctuation 
on the penn chinese treebank we obtain an error reduction of segmentation and joint segmentation and part of speech tagging over the perceptron only baseline 
the second was conducted on the penn chinese treebank ctb to test the performance of the cascaded model on segmentation and joint s t 
experiments show that the cascaded model achieves improved accuracies on both segmentation only and joint segmentation and part of speech tagging 
the perceptron algorithm introduced into nlp by collins is a simple but effective discriminative training method 
suppose we have n features gj j n coupled with n corresponding weights wj j n each feature gj gives a score gj r to a candidate r then the total score of r is given by the decoding procedure aims to find the candidate r with the highest score while the mission of the training procedure is to tune the weights wj j n to guarantee that the candidate r with the highest score happens to be the best result with a high probability 
to cope with this problem we propose a cascaded linear model inspired by the log linear model och and ney widely used in statistical machine translation to incorporate different kinds of knowledge sources
