second we treat the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model rather than using them directly for supervised training 
altun et al proposed a technique that uses graph based similarity between labeled and unlabeled parts of structured data in a discriminative framework for semi supervised learning 
we describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part of speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data but have translated text in a resource rich language 
as discussed in more detail in we use two types of vertices in our graph on the foreign language side vertices correspond to trigram types while the vertices on the english side are individual word types 
furthermore we do not connect the english vertices to each other but only to foreign language vertices the graph vertices are extracted from the different sides of a parallel corpus de df and an additional unlabeled monolingual foreign corpus ff which will be used later for training 
we tried two versions of our graph based approach feature after the first stage of label propagation eq 
the foreign language vertices denoted by vf correspond to foreign trigram types exactly as in subramanya et al 
of course we are primarily interested in applying our techniques to languages for which no labeled resources are available 
because many foreign word types are not aligned to an english word see table and we do not run label propagation on the foreign side we expect the projected information to have less coverage 
since our graph is built from a parallel corpus we can use standard word alignment techniques to align the english sentences de note that many combinations are impossible giving a pmi value of e g when the trigram type and the feature instantiation don t have words in common and their foreign language translations df label propagation in the graph will provide coverage and high recall and we therefore extract only intersected high confidence alignments de f
