topic models have been used for analyzing topic trends in research literature mann et al hall et al inferring captions for images blei and jordan social network analysis in email mccallum et al and expanding queries with topically related words in information retrieval wei and croft 
previous work on bilingual topic modeling has focused on machine translation applications which rely on sentence aligned parallel translations 
in finding a lowdimensional semantic representation topic models deliberately smooth over much of the variation present in language 
in order to make the task more difficult we train a relatively coarse grained pltm with topics on the training set 
additionally pltm can support the creation of bilingual lexica for low resource language pairs providing candidate translations for more computationally intense alignment processes without the sentence aligned translations typically used in such tasks 
outside of the field of topic modeling kawaba et al kawaba et al use a wikipedia based model to perform sentiment analysis of blog posts 
we introduced a polylingual topic model pltm that discovers topics aligned across multiple languages 
anew document tuple w w wl is generated by first drawing a tuple specific topic distribution from an asymmetric dirichlet prior with concentration parameter and base measure m then for each language l a latent topic assignment is drawn for each token in that language finally the observed tokens are themselves drawn using the language specific topic parameters wl p wl zl l n lwl zl 
when applied to comparable document collections such as wikipedia pltm supports data driven analysis of differences and similarities across all languages for readers who understand any one language
