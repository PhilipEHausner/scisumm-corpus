we proceedings of the th conference on computational natural language learning conll x pages new york city june c association for computational linguistics assume that all dependency graphs are trees but may be non projective both of which are true in the data sets we use 
for instance the system of mcdonald et al a incorporates features over the part of speech of words occurring between and around a possible head dependent relation 
these results show that the discriminative spanning tree parsing framework mcdonald et al b mcdonald and pereira is easily adapted across all these languages 
we use the mira online learner to set the weights crammer and singer mcdonald et al a since we found it trained quickly and provide good performance 
the second stage takes the output from the first and labels all the edges in the dependency graph with appropriate syntactic categories using a globally trained sequence classifier over components of the graph 
this interest has generally come about due to the computationally efficient and flexible nature of dependency graphs and their ability to easily model non projectivity in freer word order languages 
for score functions we use simple dot products between high dimensional feature representations and a weight vector assuming we have an appropriate feature representation we can find the highest scoring label sequence with viterbi s algorithm 
we have presented results showing that the spanning tree dependency parsing framework of mcdonald et al mcdonald et al b mcdonald and pereira generalizes well to languages other than english
