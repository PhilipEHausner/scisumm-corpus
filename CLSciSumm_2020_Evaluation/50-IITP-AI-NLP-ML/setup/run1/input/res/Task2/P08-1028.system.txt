we employed leave-one-out resampling (weiss and kulikowski, 1991), by correlating the data obtained from each participant with the ratings obtained from all other participants.
in this paper we examine models of semantic composition that are empirically grounded and can represent similarity relations.
the neighbors, kintsch argues, can ‘strengthen features of the predicate that are appropriate for the argument of the predication’. animal stable village gallop jokey horse 0 6 2 10 4 run 1 8 4 4 0 unfortunately, comparisons across vector composition models have been few and far between in the literature.
our results show that the multiplicative models are superior and correlate significantly with behavioral data.
in addition, bullinaria and levy (2007) found that these parameters perform well on a number of other tasks such as the synonymy task from the test ofenglish as a foreign language (toefl).
experimental results demonstrate that the multiplicative models are superior to the additive alternatives when compared against human judgments.
when modeling predicate-argument structures, kintsch (2001) proposes including one or more distributional neighbors, n, of the predicate: note that considerable latitude is allowed in selecting the appropriate neighbors.
specifically, they belonged to different synsets and were maximally dissimilar as measured by the jiang and conrath (1997) measure.3 our initial set of candidate materials consisted of 20 verbs, each paired with 10 nouns, and 2 landmarks (400 pairs of sentences in total).
an extreme form of this differential in the contribution of constituents is where one of the vectors, say u, contributes nothing at all to the combination: admittedly the model in (8) is impoverished and rather simplistic, however it can serve as a simple baseline against which to compare more sophisticated models.
