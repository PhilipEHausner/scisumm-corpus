in bod (2000b), an alternative notion for the best parse tree was proposed based on a simplicity criterion: instead of producing the most probable tree, this model produced the tree generated by the shortest derivation with the fewest training subtrees.
bod (2001) used an alternative technique which samples a fixed number of subtrees of each depth and which has the effect of assigning roughly equal weight to each node in the training data.
although bod's method obtains very competitive results on the wall street journal (wsj) task, the parsing time was reported to be over 200 seconds per sentence (bod 2003).
johnson (1998b, 2002) showed that dop1's subtree estimation method is statistically biased and inconsistent.
most previous notions of best parse tree in dop1 were based on a probabilistic metric, with bod (2000b) as a notable exception, who used a simplicity metric based on the shortest derivation.
in this paper, we will test a simple extension of goodman's compact pcfg-reduction of dop which has the same property as the normalization proposed in bod (2001) in that it assigns roughly equal weight to each node in the training data.
while sl-dop and ls-dop have been compared before in bod (2002), especially in the context of musical parsing, this paper presents the the dop approach is based on two distinctive features: (1) the use of corpus fragments rather than grammar rules, and (2) the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones.
as our second experimental goal, we compared the models sl-dop and ls-dop explained in section 3.2.
