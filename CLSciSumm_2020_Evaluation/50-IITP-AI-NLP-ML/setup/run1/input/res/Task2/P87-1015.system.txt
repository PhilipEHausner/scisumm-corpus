in considering the relationship between formalisms, we show that it is useful to abstract away from the details of the formalism, and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees. find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by context-free grammars on the basis of this observation, we describe a class of formalisms which we call linear context- free rewriting systems, and show they are recognizable in polynomial time and generate only semilinear languages.
semilinearity and the closely related constant growth property (a consequence of semilinearity) have been discussed in the context of grammars for natural languages by joshi (1983/85) and berwick and weinberg (1984).
a geometrical progression of language families defined by weir (1987) involves tree sets with increasingly complex path sets.
although embedding this version of lcfrs's in the framework of ilfp developed by rounds (1985) is straightforward, our motivation was to capture properties shared by a family of grammatical systems and generalize them defining a class of related formalisms.
in the remainder of the paper, we outline how a class of linear context-free rewriting systems (lcfrs's) may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows.
gazdar (1985) considers a restriction of ig's in which no more than one nonterminal on the right-hand-side of a production can inherit the stack from the left-hand-side.
thus, the tree sets generated by hg's are similar to those of cfg's, with each node annotated by the operation (concatenation or wrapping) used to combine the headed strings derived by the daughters of tree adjoining grammars, a tree rewriting formalism, was introduced by joshi, levy and takahashi (1975) and joshi (1983/85).
