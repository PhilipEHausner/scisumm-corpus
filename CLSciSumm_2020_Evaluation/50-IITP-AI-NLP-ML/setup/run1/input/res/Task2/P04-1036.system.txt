whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense-tagged corpus such as semcor is clearly useful, there is a strong case for obtaining a first, or predominant, sense from untagged corpus data so that a wsd system can be tuned to the genre or domain at hand.
in many cases the sense ranking provided in semcor differs to that obtained automatically because we used the bnc to produce our thesaurus.
in contrast, our work is aimed at discovering the predominant senses from raw text because the first sense heuristic is such a useful one, and because handtagged data is not always available.
additionally, we need to determine whether senses which do not occur in a wide variety of grammatical contexts fare badly using distributional measures of similarity, and what can be done to combat this problem using relation specific thesauruses.
in this paper we describe and evaluate a method for ranking senses of nouns to obtain the predominant sense of a word using the neighbours from automatically acquired thesauruses.
in order to find the predominant sense of a target word we use a thesaurus acquired from automatically parsed text based on the method of lin (1998).
we are currently investigating the performance of the first sense heuristic, and this method, for other pos on senseval-3 data (mccarthy et al., 2004), although not yet with rankings from domain specific corpora.
the automatically acquired predominant senses were evaluated against the hand-tagged resources semcor and the senseval-2 english all-words task giving us a wsd precision of 64% on an all-nouns task.
