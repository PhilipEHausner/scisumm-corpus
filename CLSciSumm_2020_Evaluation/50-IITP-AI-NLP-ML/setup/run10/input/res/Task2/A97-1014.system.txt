in general, the resulting interpreted data also are closer to semantic annotation and more neutral with respect to particular syntactic theories.
however, some other standard analysts turn out to be problematic, mainly due to the partial, idealised character of competence grammars, which often marginalise or ignore such important. phenomena. as 'deficient' (e.g. headless) constructions, appositions, temporal expressions, etc.
accuracy of the unreliable 10% of assignments is 75%, i.e., the annotator has to alter the choice in 1 of 4 cases when asked for confirmation.
apart from this rather technical problem, two further arguments speak against phrase structure as the structural pivot of the annotation scheme: finally, the structural handling of free word order means stating well-formedness constraints on structures involving many trace-filler dependencies, which has proved tedious.
structure-sharing is expressed using secondary links.
since a precise structural description of non-constituent coordination would require a. rich inventory of incomplete phrase types, we have agreed on a sort of unde.rspe.cified representations: the coordinated units are assigned structures in which missing lexical material is not represented at the level of primary links.
since most methods of handling discontinuous constituents make the formalism more powerful, the efficiency of processing deteriorates, too.
during the first phase, the focus is on annotating correct structures and a coarse-grained classification of grammatical functions, which represent the following areas of information: dependency type: complements are further classified according to features such as category and case: clausal complements (oc), accusative objects (oa), datives (da), etc.
we describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages.
