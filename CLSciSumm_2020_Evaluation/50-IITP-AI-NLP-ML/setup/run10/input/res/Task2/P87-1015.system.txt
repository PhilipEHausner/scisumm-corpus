in considering the relationship between formalisms, we show that it is useful to abstract away from the details of the formalism, and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees. find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by context-free grammars on the basis of this observation, we describe a class of formalisms which we call linear context- free rewriting systems, and show they are recognizable in polynomial time and generate only semilinear languages.
having defined lcfrs's, in section 4.2 we established the semilinearity (and hence constant growth property) of the languages generated.
the work of thatcher (1973) and rounds (1969) define formal systems that generate tree sets that are related to cfg's and ig's.
little attention, however, has been paid to the structural descriptions that these formalisms can assign to strings, i.e. their strong generative capacity.
the rewrite rules and the definition of the composition operations may be stored in the finite state control since g uses a finite number of them.
unlike gcfg's, however, the composition operations of lcfrs's are restricted to be linear (do not duplicate unboundedly large structures) and nonerasing (do not erase unbounded structures, a restriction made in most modern transformational grammars).
on the one hand, the definition of composition in steedman (1985), which technically permits composition of functions with unbounded number of arguments, generates tree sets with dependent paths such as those shown in figure 6.
