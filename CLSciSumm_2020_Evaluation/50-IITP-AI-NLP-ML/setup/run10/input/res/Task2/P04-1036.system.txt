whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense-tagged corpus such as semcor is clearly useful, there is a strong case for obtaining a first, or predominant, sense from untagged corpus data so that a wsd system can be tuned to the genre or domain at hand.
we want to investigate the effect of frequency and choice of distributional similarity measure (weeds et al., 2004).
we then use the wordnet similarity package (patwardhan and pedersen, 2003) to give us a semantic similarity measure (hereafter referred to as the wordnet similarity measure) to weight the contribution that each neighbour makes to the various senses of the target word.
our automatically acquired predominant sense performs nearly as well as the first sense provided by semcor, which is very encouraging given that our method only uses raw text, with no manual labelling.
there are words where the first sense in wordnet is counter-intuitive, because of the size of the corpus, and because where the frequency data does not indicate a first sense, the ordering is arbitrary.
we are of course able to apply the method to other versions of wordnet. synset, is incremented with the frequency counts from the corpus of all words belonging to that synset, directly or via the hyponymy relation.
we see that both domains have a similarly high percentage of factotum (domain independent) labels, but as we would expect, the other peaks correspond to the economy label for the finance corpus, and the sports label for the sports corpus. inant senses for 38 polysemous words ranked using the sports and finance corpus.
