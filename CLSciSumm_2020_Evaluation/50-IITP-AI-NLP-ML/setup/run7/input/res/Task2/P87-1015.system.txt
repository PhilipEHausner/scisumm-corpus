in considering the relationship between formalisms, we show that it is useful to abstract away from the details of the formalism, and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees. find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by context-free grammars on the basis of this observation, we describe a class of formalisms which we call linear context- free rewriting systems, and show they are recognizable in polynomial time and generate only semilinear languages.
thus, the tree sets generated by hg's are similar to those of cfg's, with each node annotated by the operation (concatenation or wrapping) used to combine the headed strings derived by the daughters of tree adjoining grammars, a tree rewriting formalism, was introduced by joshi, levy and takahashi (1975) and joshi (1983/85).
for example, gazdar (1985) discusses the applicability of indexed grammars (ig's) to natural language in terms of the structural descriptions assigned; and berwick (1984) discusses the strong generative capacity of lexical-functional grammar (lfg) and government and bindings grammars (gb).
for example, in tag's a derived auxiliary tree spans two substrings (to the left and right of the foot node), and the adjunction operation inserts another substring (spanned by the subtree under the node where adjunction takes place) between them (see figure 3).
since every cfl is known to be semilinear (parikh, 1966), in order to show semilinearity of some language, we need only show the existence of a letter equivalent cfl our definition of lcfrs's insists that the composition operations are linear and nonerasing.
