we see that both domains have a similarly high percentage of factotum (domain independent) labels, but as we would expect, the other peaks correspond to the economy label for the finance corpus, and the sports label for the sports corpus. inant senses for 38 polysemous words ranked using the sports and finance corpus.
for example, the neighbours of star in a dependency-based thesaurus provided by lin 1 has the ordered list of neighbours: superstar, player, teammate, actor early in the list, but one can also see words that are related to another sense of star e.g. galaxy, sun, world and planet further down the list.
we then use the wordnet similarity package (patwardhan and pedersen, 2003) to give us a semantic similarity measure (hereafter referred to as the wordnet similarity measure) to weight the contribution that each neighbour makes to the various senses of the target word.
in particular, we will use balanced and domain specific corpora to isolate words having very different neighbours, and therefore rankings, in the different corpora and to detect and target words for which there is a highly skewed sense distribution in these corpora.
whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense-tagged corpus such as semcor is clearly useful, there is a strong case for obtaining a first, or predominant, sense from untagged corpus data so that a wsd system can be tuned to the genre or domain at hand.
additionally, we need to determine whether senses which do not occur in a wide variety of grammatical contexts fare badly using distributional measures of similarity, and what can be done to combat this problem using relation specific thesauruses.
