topic models have been used for analyzing topic trends in research literature mann et al hall et al inferring captions for images blei and jordan social network analysis in email mccallum et al and expanding queries with topically related words in information retrieval wei and croft 
in finding a lowdimensional semantic representation topic models deliberately smooth over much of the variation present in language 
previous work on bilingual topic modeling has focused on machine translation applications which rely on sentence aligned parallel translations 
additionally pltm can support the creation of bilingual lexica for low resource language pairs providing candidate translations for more computationally intense alignment processes without the sentence aligned translations typically used in such tasks 
in order to make the task more difficult we train a relatively coarse grained pltm with topics on the training set 
outside of the field of topic modeling kawaba et al kawaba et al use a wikipedia based model to perform sentiment analysis of blog posts 
figure shows the proportion of all tokens in english and finnish assigned to each topic under lda and pltm with topics 
this topic provides an illustration of the variation in technical terminology captured by pltm including the wide array of acronyms used by different languages 
although direct translations in multiple languages are relatively rare in contrast with comparable documents we use direct translations to explore the characteristics of the model 
one simple way to achieve this topic alignment is to add a small set of comparable document tuples that provide sufficient glue to bind the topics together
