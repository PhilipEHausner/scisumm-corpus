feedback from the context for example the lexical entry for borders world has been used to guide both syntactic parsing is s np np ay ax border x y which means schuler and semantic parsing popescu et borders looks right for the first argument and left al clarke et al 
trace inspired by discourse representation theory drt predicates can be inserted anywhere but the fea kamp and reyle kamp et al where tures favor some insertions depending on the words variables are discourse referents 
this algorithm is linear in the number of nodes times the size of the denotations now the dual importance of trees in dcs is clear we have seen that trees parallel syntactic dependency structure which will facilitate parsing 
rather than using lexical triggers several of the other systems use ibm word alignment models to produce an initial word predicate mapping 
to further reduce the search space f imposes a few additional constraints e g limiting the number of marked nodes to and only allowing trace predicates between arity predicates 
answering these types of complex questions compositionally involves first mapping the questions into logical forms semantic parsing 
our employed zettlemoyer and collins or words work pushes the grounded language agenda towards are given multiple lexical entries kwiatkowski et deeper representations of language think grounded al compositional semantics 
the main technical contribution of this work is a new semantic representation dependency based compositional semantics dcs which is both simple and expressive section 
think of dcs as a higher level our system learns lexical associations between programming language tailored to natural language words and predicates
