in general the resulting interpreted data also are closer to semantic annotation and more neutral with respect to particular syntactic theories 
the development of linguistically interpreted corpora presents a laborious and time consuming task 
however some other standard analysts turn out to be problematic mainly due to the partial idealised character of competence grammars which often marginalise or ignore such important phenomena as deficient e g headless constructions appositions temporal expressions etc 
in addition a number of clear cut np cornponents can be defined outside that juxtapositional kernel pre and postnominal genitives gl gr relative clauses rc clausal and sentential complements oc 
a uniform representation of local and non local dependencies makes the structure more transparent 
the following features of our formalism are then of particular importance the current tagset comprises only node labels and function tags yet a finely grinned classification will take place in the near future 
as the annotation scheme described in this paper focusses on annotating argument structure rather than constituent trees it differs from existing treebanks in several aspects 
accuracy of the unreliable of assignments is i e the annotator has to alter the choice in of cases when asked for confirmation 
partial automation included in the current version significantly reduces the manna effort 
however full or partial disambiguation takes place in context and the annotators do not consider unrealistic readings 
owing to the partial automation the average annotation efficiency improves by from around minutes to minutes per sentence 
data drivenness the scheme must provide representational means for all phenomena occurring in texts
