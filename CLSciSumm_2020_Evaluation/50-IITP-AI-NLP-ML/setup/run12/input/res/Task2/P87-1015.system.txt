in considering the relationship between formalisms we show that it is useful to abstract away from the details of the formalism and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by context free grammars on the basis of this observation we describe a class of formalisms which we call linear context free rewriting systems and show they are recognizable in polynomial time and generate only semilinear languages 
in the remainder of the paper we outline how a class of linear context free rewriting systems lcfrs s may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows 
semilinearity and the closely related constant growth property a consequence of semilinearity have been discussed in the context of grammars for natural languages by joshi and berwick and weinberg 
from thatcher s work it is obvious that the complexity of the set of paths from root to frontier of trees in a local set the tree set of a cfg is regular 
a geometrical progression of language families defined by weir involves tree sets with increasingly complex path sets 
in the next section we show how an atm can accept the strings generated by a grammar in a lcfrs formalism in logspace and hence show that each family can be recognized in polynomial time 
it is known that cfg s hg s and tag s can be recognized in polynomial time since polynomial time algorithms exist in for each of these formalisms
