thus the major innovations of dop are the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones both have gained or are gaining wide usage and are also becoming relevant for theoretical linguistics see bod et al a 
this innovation has not become generally adopted yet many approaches still work either with local trees i e single level rules with limited means of information percolation or with restricted fragments as in stochastic tree adjoining grammar schabes chiang that do not include nonlexicalized fragments 
bod used an alternative technique which samples a fixed number of subtrees of each depth and which has the effect of assigning roughly equal weight to each node in the training data 
in bod b an alternative notion for the best parse tree was proposed based on a simplicity criterion instead of producing the most probable tree this model produced the tree generated by the shortest derivation with the fewest training subtrees 
although bod s method obtains very competitive results on the wall street journal wsj task the parsing time was reported to be over seconds per sentence bod 
while sl dop and ls dop have been compared before in bod especially in the context of musical parsing this paper presents the the dop approach is based on two distinctive features the use of corpus fragments rather than grammar rules and the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones 
goodman then shows by simple induction that subderivations headed by a with external nonterminals at the roots and leaves internal nonterminals elsewhere have probability a
