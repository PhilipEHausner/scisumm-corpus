second we treat the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model rather than using them directly for supervised training 
we describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part of speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data but have translated text in a resource rich language 
altun et al proposed a technique that uses graph based similarity between labeled and unlabeled parts of structured data in a discriminative framework for semi supervised learning 
as discussed in more detail in we use two types of vertices in our graph on the foreign language side vertices correspond to trigram types while the vertices on the english side are individual word types 
furthermore we do not connect the english vertices to each other but only to foreign language vertices the graph vertices are extracted from the different sides of a parallel corpus de df and an additional unlabeled monolingual foreign corpus ff which will be used later for training 
we tried two versions of our graph based approach feature after the first stage of label propagation eq 
while there might be some controversy about the exact definition of such a tagset these categories cover the most frequent part of speech and exist in one form or another in all of the languages that we studied 
it is worth noting that the middle words of the italian trigrams are nouns too which exhibits the fact that the similarity metric connects types having the same syntactic category 
given the bilingual graph described in the previous section we can use label propagation to project the english pos labels to the foreign language
