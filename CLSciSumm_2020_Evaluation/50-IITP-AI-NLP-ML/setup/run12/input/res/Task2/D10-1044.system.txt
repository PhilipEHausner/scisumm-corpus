this is a standard adaptation problem for smt 
we obtained positive results using a very simple phrase based system in two different adaptation settings using english french europarl to improve a performance on a small specialized medical domain and using non news portions of the nist training material to improve performance on the news related corpora 
it is also worth pointing out a connection with daum e s work that splits each feature into domain specific and general copies 
the linear lm lin lm tm lin tm and map tm map tm used with non adapted counterparts perform in all cases slightly worse than the log linear combination which adapts both lm and tm components 
moving beyond directly related work major themes in smt adaptation include the ir hildebrand et al l u et al zhao et al and mixture finch and sumita foster and kuhn koehn and schroeder l u et al approaches for lms and tms described above as well as methods for exploiting monolingual in domain text typically by translating it automatically and then performing self training bertoldi and federico ueffing et al schwenk and senellart 
experiments are presented in section 
a final alternate approach would be to combine weighted joint frequencies rather than conditional estimates ie ci s t w s t co s t suitably normalized such an approach could be simulated by a map style combination in which separate t values were maintained for each t this would make the model more powerful but at the cost of having to learn to downweight out separately for each t which we suspect would require more training data for reliable performance
